       "  'comments': 'Kiss goodbye to your privacy! Why 9.99%? So our privacy getting sold to foreign company for Rs.43,574 Cr.\\n\\nTotal Jio users : around [37 Cr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio)\\n\\nValue of one user\\'s privacy : Rs. 1177 /-\\n\\nEverything who you are for around 15 US dollars. How is it ethical for an ISP to be owned by a data mining company like Facebook? Just fyi; Rs. 43,574 cr = $6.33 billion There is also some sort of agreement between JioMart and WhatsApp involved with this deal. And few days ago there was news regarding Facebook (WhatsApp) and Jio creating an integrated platform like WeChat in China which will encompass everything from groceries to payments and all. Jio and Facebook teaming up to make super app like we chat. Word on the street earlier was both decided to make independently. Now it\\'s a coalition for sure. Friend request accepted. Very wise action from Facebook\\'s point of view. This vertical integration gives them a solid control over a high-potential developing market. They can also leverage India as a launch pad to capture other SEA nations. From the consumer\\'s point of view, this development is a strong threat to their privacy. The government should have implemented stronger data protection laws before allowing such mergers to take place. One demon buys stake in another demon\\'s workshop! People talking about how this is bad should remember that Jio is worse than FB on the privacy front. Hope net neutrality prevails Facebook perspective :\\n\\nWhile you assume Govt would already be in their pocket, Zuckerberg goes on to hire Richest man in Asia as his PR face, his go-to man for India... Obviously it is going to cost a lot of money.. But is it totally worth to have Mukesh Bhai on your side.\\n\\nMark Zuckerberg is clear about his vision for Facebook. For him Facebook is Internet. For him, FB is like Polio. एक भी बच्चा छूट ना जाए, सुरक्षा चक्र टूट ना जाए. After deal with Jio, his is looking to penetrate further into Indian market. And that is bound to happen.\\n\\nAND, content. Digital space.\\n\\nEntertainment\\nNews\\nGames\\n\\nFB has kind of tired hands in all 3 without massive success they expect. Jio is trying hand in all 3 right now. Let\\'s see how it works jointly.\\n\\nWith so much influence in Indian digital space, tough for others to survive.\\n\\nAnd yes. WhatsApp payment. That\\'s a done deal now, I assume.\\n\\nPaytm is getting slaughtered from all sides right now. Gpay eating up UPI market. Phonepe is there (yes,just there,still trying to be SuperApp)..And now WhatsApp UPI. Ooh, Softbank\\n\\nFB vs Google.. With Google in lead. To all those blaming and getting scared of their privacy because now Jio will sell you out, you realize every app on your phone like dating apps. gaming apps, social media apps, those image uploader apps and what not already have access to your privacy and that \"your privacy\" is already on the market to be sold. \\n\\nHow do you think these unwanted call centers have your details. \\nWe all just click the \"I accept\" button without reading the entire terms and conditions. That I accept button is I accept giving my access to my privacy to the App. Data mining at its best begins now. Opt out from JIO even if it gives you the best offer. Slowly all indian companies will be owned by Americans Aao, milke beche logo ki zindagi, aap mai aur faijbuk Laughing on all of you android users- Xprivacy lua user on rooted android. Reliance stock was fun for today\\'s day traders ahh... so thats why they banned china from investing... but didnt write the law saying all FDI is curtailed.\\n\\nMukesh bhai has sold the refinery biz to Saudi Aramco and Jio to Facebook .. both monopolies built using regulatory help. Jio\\'s spying will be now even more efficient! So far only journalists are going to jail because they publish. Now even common people will go to jail because of what they write on Facebook and SMS etc. Is Jio worth only 435740 Cr..is it due to the market slump due to covid? I thought it\\'s much more worth.. being such a bige network provider..! Next step- attack on free internet for all 9.99 % stake. Why couldn\\'t he buy or negotiate to an even 10 %. 10% of Jio and a majority stake in Mudiji is a very good deal for $5Bn we may get free internet at cost of privacy.\\n\\n facebook may not budge to internet shutdown in government asks.\\n\\nfinally porn ban could be lifted.\\n\\nmukesh ambani is despretate to payback the jio loans , he is ready to sell assests in a covid market crash.\\n\\nif govt announces  a bail out package to save mukesh , how will people take it Airtel for the classes and Jio for the masses. What about Vodafone Idea, Sirji? WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook & now Jio... Facebook company knows more about you than what you know about yourself! Remember Facebook said they will give free internet and we said NO? Now they found a better & legal way out. This is fucked up, India is next china and Zuckerberg is Xi Jinping Glad I don\\'t have Jio lol. Jumped ship in  nick of time, I guess. Not that Airtel is any good but Jio had my privacy alarms go off quite early.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhWfTEvF1Tw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhWfTEvF1Tw) And there you have it folks......\\n\\nOur privacy is a joke.....\\n\\nI would rather have them burst a balloon filed with confetti with the words privacy written on it than this...... Facebook right now owns the most used social network of India (WhatsApp) AND the biggest ISP of India (Reliance) what could go wrong? Anyone think that fb + jio will jump into streaming service market for india like netflix and prime? Ight imma switch to airtel as soon as it’s possible. I don’t like where this is going. Welcome to Jio-tagging. switch and use open source softwares fellow people.    \\nInstall them and teach your parents and friends how to use them along the way.   \\n\\nMove away from private tech companies and services if there are alternative.    \\nAnd designers/coders with free time consider donating your time/code to FOSS projects(big or small) Now they have all the Adhar data in their hand। Officially। Ambani looks like that fat king from the eldorado meme They will monopolize all of the advertisements on those Jio platform apps. Nice move business wise. As someone mentioned Jio has 37 cr. Users imagine the possibility even if they earn Rs. 2 per user per day. Meanwhile Indian government is busy preventing China from making FDIs, while laying bare for America. Reliance perspective :\\n\\nJio individually valued at $66bn (@ $=70, pre money 4.62L cr).... Twice the market value of Airtel (2.73L cr).... In <5 yrs..\\n\\nThis is some crazy stuff.\\n\\n$25bn risk of Mukesh Ambani paid-off well.\\n\\nIn his August AGM, Mukesh Ambani had said, RIL is going to be debt free within next 18 months...\\n\\n2 things were clear, India\\'s biggest company had little confidence left in Indian Banking system and India\\'s new Inspector Raj.\\n\\n20 % stake to Aramco in oil-chemical business.. 49% to BP in fuel retailing business and now 10% to FB in Jio. Path to debt free is crystal clear.\\n\\nYou know, you suppose to be very scared when Mukesh Ambani fears arm twisting from government. Can anyone explain please, I don\\'t understand. Does 99% stake means only 1% of the company belongs to Reliance now? I wish that Reliance CEO will take care of the data of Indian. Because everyone knows about Facebook Not good. Data privacy? What is that now? People have a problem with no jobs and no investments coming in from foreign companies. Now when things are happening people are concerned about privacy. Whatever tools you use today is free so they of course need to share data. Looks like Facebook wants to Own Indian internet. How exactly are they profiting from analyzing user data ? In Layman\\'s term please Chutiya company knows chutiya company. I don\\'t use either cheers 🍿 JIO should be changed to MARO now. East India company: reborn   \\n\\n· “Great share”       [https://shrikantpatel22.blogspot.com/2020/01/31lets-learn-at-words-in-some-languages.html](https://shrikantpatel22.blogspot.com/2020/01/31lets-learn-at-words-in-some-languages.html),          \\n\\nDear Friends ! Lets read my blog and knowing new and different words Assuming there was any to begin with from Jio? Every Jio app asks for all the possible permissions You thought we had privacy till now? lol You had already surrendered your privacy the day when you used jio sim. Time to activate Ron Swanson mode.... DELETE ALL PICTURES OF RON!!! Glad I have deleted Facebook and I\\'m not even reliance customer. Somewhat safe Exactly. Facebook\\'s business model is all about private data. Reliance and Jio has built a mammoth repository of Indian\\'s data. This is nothing but sale of personal data of Indians to a foreign company. Jio has deep packet inspection. What privacy? yeah. What does this post mean?? I think it has to do with the difference between FDI & FPI. Less than 10% stake is considered as FPI. **FDI** means the investor makes investment in buildings and machineries directly in the company in which they made the investment. ... **FPI** on the other hand is investment aimed at getting profits from shares, interests from deposits etc. Cox cliche. Price tag would have been like that. /s US GAAP accounting. <10% is passive investment for Facebook and they will not have to report particulars about their Jio operations for taxes and shareholders. 10 - 50 % requires equity accounting and more declarations. these percentages are sort of arbitrary, but any value <10% is away easier to defend against tax authorities in the US Jio also has huge infrastructure across India. If facebook only wanted the data they could have made the deal for orders of magnitude less. Also to note, Jio already tracks you more shamelessly than facebook If you use Google you have already sold your privacy for next to nothing. Log to 10 rupe ke cashback ke liye apni privacy bech dete hai yha bhai 15 dollar to phir bhi bahaut hai This is an incomplete breakdown. Remember Jio has clientele from a new internet adopter in a village to a corporate office using Jio fibre in a metropolitan city. The purchase is not just for the number of subscribers, but also the distribution of subscribers. It is insane that this is being allowed. Value of our privacy is even less as there are also other underlying assets that are built in into that price. But as the new saying, goes data is the new oil. And reliance seems to have outsourced (data) refining... can i get my $15 ? actually I am guessing Facebook has more information on Indians than Jio, given how everyone is on Facebook even if they are not on Jio... So am I the only one still using Airtel Its not about privacy, Jio and Facebook are collaborating to build an super app similar to Wechat\\n\\nThe initial idea for the app is to build a communication platform which lets users perform other functions, connecting it to other Reliance-owned platforms. Users would also be able to buy groceries at Reliance Retail online stores, shop at ajio.com, or make payments through Jio’s payment app JioMoney. The app would be a social media, digital payments, gaming and flight and hotel bookings app all rolled into one. What\\'s great time for FB to buy, share prices are already low and rupee is cheap. I never knew, I was worth so much. for Facebook, $15 is pretty hefty price man. They are getting here for free in USA. You are wrong buddy, both are data mining company. Facebook only has data you willingly shared while Jio has data you were forced to share..... Adhar card, link it with everything but when it comes to providing relief, Ration Card is the only document allowed. Giant companies like Facebook and Google do not label any data. All the people talking about privacy need to know how your data is used. You as a individual are not special. They don\\'t go and read your msgs or emails. What they do is try to draw inferences from a large amount of data. So your absolute privacy is safe. Even if they had access to it, they are not interested in what websites you visited individually. They don\\'t care about your puny data as much as you think they do. Analyzing big data is a far more intensive task than collecting it. You giving them data is no big deal and in return you are using so much of their free services.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIf you are concerned about your privacy there are tons of alternative to Google services and again they don\\'t care about you as a individual. What they do look for is trends from all the data collected. Again data analytics requires intensive time and resources to draw inferences from. So for once don\\'t go spreading misinformation and take off your tin foil hat. Where is it written in the ethics notebook? They are capitalists they only care about the dollars. Jio is worth 60 Billion? Thats a good amount man Moving towards dictatorship? Bhai tera whatsapp Zuckerberg dada ka hi hai already. More like added to the WhatsApp group by admin! Government was onto something with data protection bill. Although it did introduce some stringent measures of GDPR it had wide and full blown exceptions for govt. itself to which we objected crying privacy. Now we are here, again crying for privacy. Ultimately it is one way or the other. Wasn\\'t Facebook trying to do the same with their data zero plan way back ? I guess they were trying to make it work with Airtel for similar purpose right ? Shows you they had eye on us for really long time Fb is better (worse) at data analytics and manipulation. So this is a terrible scenario. Sapne dekhne me koi galat baat nahi bhai My tinfoil hat was firing all around when India put a stop to freebasics. I said, how can it be? A country that struggles with the most basic social issues, be so progressive when it comes to a topic as nuanced as net neutrality and put a stop to a mega corporation with billions of dollars behind their back? Maybe there were greater forces at play that day. Somebody needed their cut and now they have it. Curious question! Why do I panic if I see ads more targeted towards my interests? (Since that\\'s what it\\'ll essentially do) I\\'m only going to buy stuff, if I want to. Only time will tell China?? The investment is in Jio Platforms Ltd. Its not the same as Jio Infocomm Ltd, which we know as Jio. Maybe its a subsidiary. Jio platform holds the digital assets of jio. Like the movies, music, e-commerce, etc. But its not jio in its entirety. Jio platforms is being valued at the amount you written, not all of jio. [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5swem/facebook\\\\_buys\\\\_999\\\\_stake\\\\_in\\\\_reliance\\\\_jio\\\\_for\\\\_rs/fo5ggig/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5swem/facebook_buys_999_stake_in_reliance_jio_for_rs/fo5ggig/) Rather he negotiated it to 9.99% 😝 Apart from your first statement, you are sadly wrong about all other predictions Victims of Competition commission of india\\'s failure. Yeah. This is exactly that\\'s going to happen. whatsapp is not social media Jio $66 bn valuation. How did you get this number? As far as i know this investment is into Jio Platforms Ltd, a part of the Jio Group. So its not Jio valuation but a part of it 9.9% stake is sold, not 99%. Simple answer - Ads\\n\\nJust like google, if they know what you like, where you are, you preference for food, shopping, content, payment etc, they can target you with specific services. And advertisers are willing to pay huge sums of money for this precise targeting at the right time. This is Google\\'s bread and butter and every other company is trying to replicate this at the largest possible scale https://i.imgur.com/UPGjpqm.jpg\\n\\nthe app works even when you don\\'t give them any permission but people like to press \"Allow\" instead of \"Deny and don\\'t ask again\"\\n\\nedit: downloaded jioTV and jioSaavn. jioTV won\\'t work without phone and location permission. Fuck that So did Facebook. Infact Facebook knows more about you than Jio and you combined. I only install it when I recharge my plan. Then quickly uninstall. Or since the day you started using social media Even if you are not on facebook, they create what they call a **Shadow Profile** of \"non-users\" i don’t know about india but in us u have to report your daily moves if you buy more than 10% in a company..this is why barring few exceptions buffet almost never buys more than 10% in a company. https://www.gurufocus.com/news/898907/warren-buffett-on-his-10-rule They are not idiots. The data is more valuable than any physical infra they have. Infra is the platform, your data is the product. You are now officially sold. You don\\'t matter anymore. Happy oblivion. 👍 For anyone who hasn\\'t yet visited their google myactivity page and deleted your data:  [https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) \\n\\nThe first time I deleted my data, I was looking at location data and search queries since 2014. It used to be two or three buttons to delete all my data from all the google services. Now they have redesigned it - go to \"other google activity\" and you see 20 other links and buttons to delete data. They are making it harder to delete your data. Yeah tbh given a choice, I would trust my data to be with google way more than FB. They tell you upfront what they’re going to do, and if you want, you can even opt out. I am using Google services on a Xiaomi phone. My privacy is absolutely rekt. Facebook doesn\\'t have your biometrics unlike reliance through mandatory adhaar card authorisation. How is any of this alleviating the concerns of privacy? a super app which permeates through all these things, backed by facebook and ambani sounds like a privacy nightmare. Kangna didi ne apko hi bataya aake after telling Modi to boycott Twitter. It\\'s cute that all you\\'re thinking about is adhaar. Jio literally has a calling and messaging app that goes through all of a user\\'s communication. Add to that the fact that Jio has been rumoured to be carrying out deep packet inspection. This means in principle Jio has access to all of a user\\'s activity (communication and browsing!). \\n\\nMoreover, Jio has also sold custom phones to low income and new to internet users. This itself is a goldmine for Zuckerberg. Remember their stealthy \"free basics\" that was stopped at the last moment? This is a diluted version of that by piggybacking on Jio. They are able to look for trends by gathering as much data as possible. The side effect is that they are now also able to violate your privacy. Whether they do or not is up for debate. But the fact that they can is enough to make it questionable. Particularly when there are monopolies involved, virtual or real.\\n\\nI think you’re also either not aware of or conveniently forgetting incidents like Cambridge Analytica. Just because data analytics is a professional field with a respectable amount of effort put into it does not mean its usage is absolved of scrutiny. >They don\\'t go and read your msgs or emails\\n\\nNada. They do that. How come you see advertisements of things you were talking about with your peers or searching for online. I have personally seen such ads of things I was talking about with my friends on Whatsapp. Isn\\'t targeted advertising the result of all these individual data collected. And it makes sense also, suppose you are in the market to buy something and are not satisfied with the price tag. Your web browser could help you to tag with much cheaper options in the market.\\n\\nIn the larger scheme of things, they could also do that to identify trends using all the fancy machine learning and analytics stuff. That\\'s like saying to a drop of water that you individually don\\'t matter. The dam is not trying to hold you specifically. You can evaporate or crease to exist whenever you want. It won\\'t matter to the dam or the village around it. Building a dam is a very complex and huge project. It wasn\\'t done for you.\\n\\nAll of that is true. The problem though comes when a billion (a trillion?) of water droplets happen to cross the dam together. Individually none of them mattered, but collectively they resulted in a disaster, flooded the entire village and possibly caused death! > They don\\'t go and read your msgs or emails.\\n\\nSome employees who have access can do that though but I am pretty sure their internal activity will be monitored. [deleted] You miss the point. It\\'s not just privacy from the corporation. It\\'s privacy from the government as well. They will be forced to hand over any data to the government at any time. Authoritarian regimes will have free use of this data and use it to target anyone they don\\'t like. The actual Jio company is not worth anything for Facebook. It\\'s the sweet sweet data they are going after. Especially rural ares,villages and shit. They probably havent even heard of privacy WeChat has gazillion more functionality unlike whatsapp. You can order food, buy stuff online, transfer money and much much more. That\\'s why it\\'s called super app. Why should it be one way or the other? Most of us want private companies to have very little access to data and government to have access to our data only during special cases, like national security. It\\'s not too much to ask for. Maybe they understood the power of Motabhai Sapne suhane ladakpan ke! :V Well you are providing the companies this data for free and they are making money by selling it to third parties. These third parities might be advertisement agencies or manufacturing companies. https://youtu.be/YNp4OqdxHWI\\n\\nJump to 5:25 It\\'s a bubble, built on slave labour.\\nThey can\\'t sustain if thier GDP per capita will rise.\\nChina can never replace America as the world\\'s superpower.\\nI mean no country can. USA is unstoppable. That makes more sense now.. and a hint of wow as well.. It’s a social network allowing you to talk to other people and share pictures, videos and other media about yourself. It is definitely a social network That $66 bn (@Rs. 70 =1$) is official Valuation. Jio platforms is holding company of Jio infocom in addition to their other offerings. Yes, it is indeed valuation of entitre Jio product range. Ads is the short term income. The long term profit is to know the thinking of the users, what they want, what they are discussing. All these can be used to influence every big decision(political, military, intellectual, strategic, environmental, everything) in this world. Location is for target based ads I install that app during recharges, then uninstall that immediately. Nothing like that for iPhone : https://imgur.com/gallery/e7i4cUE Phone permission is required to pause playback when a call comes. And location I think is required because the content will be shown will country specific. Netflix does by ip address. \\n\\nMy best guess, I\\'m not an app developer. Or since the day you started using mobile phone Or when you took birth on earth. That’s why they bought a 9.99% stake in Jio. \\n\\nJust like many car manufacturers scale engines down to 1498cc because the duty and excise costs are higher for 1500cc and above. That’s for listed companies. In India it’s 1%. In India it’s under SEBI SAST Regulations (substantial acquisition of shares and takeover). Once you start holding 1%, you need to declare every subsequent purchases of shares. Same thing what people’s bank of china had to do when it upped its stake from 0.8% to 1.1% in housing finance company HDFC Ltd.\\n\\nThe FDI-FPI is the reason probably in this case. correction : You are the product. \"Even when activity is deleted, some data about your use of Google services may be kept for the life of your Google Account. For example, after you delete a search from My Activity, your account will store the fact that you searched for something, but not what you searched for.\"\\n\\nLol Deleting. Does it even matter? It\\'s just a button to provide solace to helpless human souls. Holy fuck they are tracking every second of our lives. I knew we are getting tracked but I had no idea it was this bad. For eg Tracking your entire app usage is just horrible. Wow, so apparently I googled ‘Deepthroat Meaning’ and ‘handjob gif’ when I was 14. Yeah. Some time back I noticed they have  my location marker occasionally even when i never turn on location. Deleting doesn\\'t work. I deleted my data many times and google app is recommending searches I did 6-7 months ago. > you can even opt out\\n\\nI hope it was that easy. Lol. Google tells you when it collects data and what it collected? Really?\\n\\n\\nI work in digital advertising, please.....Google is far worse, they are just very good at providing services for free [deleted] I want whatever you are smoking The difference is just PR. DPI doesn\\'t work with HTTPS though, does it? And almost every webpages are through HTTPS, I doubt how efficient is DPI for the ISPs. Rumored to use DPI ? It ALREADY USES DPI , try opening any torrent sites on jio it wont display ( Sorry due to DoT rules and regulations we cant show bla bla ..... ) rather it would straight up lead to HTTPS error . THEY ARE USING DPI. Incorrect.\\n\\nDPI [does not mean they can break https](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20814/does-using-https-tls-s-mime-ssl-e-t-c-protect-you-from-deep-packet-inspectio) (or say the Signal protocol that whatsapp uses). this has never happened with me, an extrmely frequent shopper.\\n\\nthe only suggestions i get is from searches i do on shopping websites Damn dude, chill 😩 🤯 data in itself can\\'t do shit. There has to be manipulation. But that allows big companies like facebook collect your all kind of personal data way more easily, they\\'re gonna know whom you communicate with to what you eat or where do you spend your money.... Well they have been doing that one for ages now but still this is concerning if they make app like wechat for india That\\'s what the Hike messenger was before they shut off all the super app features And we are using their services, right? What would happen if Google put Maps behind a paywall? Or start charging for Gmail or Drive? You can say you have alternatives, but there is a reason why Google is more popular than the others.\\n\\nAnd I can argue that your data and my data is not worthier than the Google Maps feature. True but it\\'s not like anybody would buy my data anyway if I sold it. It\\'s not something I can make money out of it. Best case scenario, Jio or any other companies lower their price or introduce some fancy offers to get more users on board. To get the data, yes but I\\'d say it\\'s a fair trade. Again, I\\'m only buying stuff from the ads if I want to. (I have yet to buy something through the ads btw). r/usernamechecksout Lol..bro...i don\\'t know whether chinas passes usa or not  but usa is one fucked up country for sure K. ah read it wrong.. sorry True, its the targeting ability that\\'s the core here, and you can build an advertising empire or the best propaganda machine on top of it. Also because it\\'s only for India Privacy is gone already Exactly and don\\'t give it any permissions. App developer here, phone permission is **not** required to pause/playback when a call comes. Location is not required since a jio sim will only be working in India. Also all location specific content is determined by using your IP address, not your GPS. The reason might be that jiotv requires active jio sim subscription for playing >pause playback when a call comes\\n\\njust checked with jioSaavn. paused playback during incoming call. no permissions You can completely turn of permissions for location on a PC, windows or Unix and Netflix and YouTube and Vimeo and whatever all work. Including the phone apps. I also don’t know of any popular video app that needs phone permission. But you’re most likely being tracked anyway permission or not. Data is very valuable. As a commodity. To a lot of parties. Companies do bad shit for less. Fuck corprotocracy. Pretty sure I messed up that spelling. Location based content filtering is done by ISP and not by physical location of phone. Smartphone.\\n\\nFTFY > Same thing what people’s bank of china had to do when it upped its stake from 0.8% to 1.1% in housing finance company HDFC Ltd.\\n\\nAnd suddenly govt figured out China is using economic downturn due to covid to buy stake in Indian companies. After that, all other investments coming from China needs to be approved by the govt. It does. Due to GDPR or other compliances falling to follow them could lead to huge repercussions, such as huge asking if penalty to the company from different governments, reputation hit which could lead to soar market/stock prices if company if public. Nope, I think only a few European countries are actually beholden to privacy laws. Exactly thats what I think, I don\\'t think it\\'s ever removed from their hdds I can\\'t opt out from providing location data for Gpay when all other UPI apps work without location. its easy if you try. > Google tells you when it collects data and what it collected? Really?\\n\\nYes. EU will put a dildo up Google\\'s ass if they violate GDPR. Agree. But, at least with google you get services like maps etc...With Facebook? No way. Just for the freebies that jio offers, can’t risk ones data to be all over Facebook, which has already a very bad reputation when it comes to privacy! so much power lol\\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9AX3Eza.jpg How safe is using VPN? Correct. DPI only means they are going beyond the TCP/IP layer into the application layer. So with https they may know that your packet is a HTTP package going to, say, a Zerodha server. This means they know you are active in trading stonks.\\n\\nBut they don\\'t know what that packet contains. They don\\'t know the actual address (zerodha.com/thispage.html), what data is on the page, or what data you submitted to that page.\\n\\nStill valuable info for them, and nearly all ISPs do it for traffic shaping.\\n\\nEdit: changed protocol layer to TCP/IP layer Plus with dns over https if you are using firefox dpi will be rendered useless. Well Well , DPI is specifically for HTTPS secured sites , https doesnt encrypt the metadata that you supply during a connection , you can (if you want to read more here) \\nhttps://security.stackexchange.com/questions/64568/how-does-a-country-block-censor-an-encrypted-website-https You should be more concerned by growing power of reliance. You don\\'t want a conglomerate controlling a country like Russia. With this super app, they can increase their market share and venture into e-commerce. “Google maps” would not be behind a paywall because they too collect data but not the way fb is collecting. And they are charging for gmail /gdrive for higher capacity. What you are using is the free version. You make a fair point, BUT data mining doesn’t stop at targeting ads. What you don’t know is that [FB has been recording all the texts on your phone, all your phone calls, etc. or creating \"shadow profiles\" of your family members who didn\\'t even use FB.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/5899953/facebook-listening-texts-calls-how-to-stop/)  That\\'s way beyond the scope of what people imagined would ever happen and it\\'s the reason they\\'re being called in front of more than one country\\'s governing body to answer for it.\\n\\nSecondly, In China, that exact same social media data is being used to suppress dissent. That data is being exploited to bar activists and dissidents from transportation, and to give special privileges to people who make positive statements about the government and the economy, and to encourage people to interact with peers who \"think good thoughts.\"\\n\\nIt might feel like that would never happen in your state, which you might think of as an impenetrable democracy. But it\\'s already happening.[The information is being used by third parties to affect elections](https://theprint.in/politics/exclusive-inside-story-cambridge-analytica-actually-india/44012/) My mind boggles that people are willing to put their most private conversations and pictures up to save a few bucks. It’s not adverts.  People don’t say, hey that’s vickys data, that’s useless. It’s more like hmm, he said he liked broccoli on Reddit, let’s sell that part of the data to the respective party. Oh! There are 10 people who like broccoli, let’s go use advertisement in that area. \\nOR \\npoliticians could harvest the data for vote banks. \\n\\nIt’s limitless with what you can do with ones data.  By offering low rates for a connection is what they will do to lure you to them. \\n\\nAre you from a data harvester or work for jio or a journalists?  Journalists are leeches who get idea and asks such questions like you have asked on social media to write their article and they never do their homework That\\'s what everyone was saying for past 200 years.\\nYou all will be proven wrong. America will rise again.\\nSetbacks are part of American history, but nothing could stop them. Even the reddit you using right now is American. Indians have absolutely nothing except cheap slave labour just like the Chinese. That is one of the factors, but primarily they need your exact location for showing location based ads. totally true if that was the case, then why don\\'t other music players ask for phone permission. Thats handled by phone itself, if i am not wrong. How does it pause? They can’t check active subscription using phone permissions, it’s just for incoming and outgoing calls.\\n\\nThey can check the active subscription on their own servers. No need for phone permissions. Why didn\\'t you believe me? I feel bad :\\'( Well, they had your call logs, text messages and live location before that too. I don\\'t see that as a problem if the payout is more to them. People forget. Some of the biggest banks in the world. Wells, JP, Goldman have all been scandal-hit but they still are the pillars of banking today. And Google has been hit with fines before they pay that and move on. You don\\'t *have* to use Google Pay. Burn down google data centres. Got it. No hell below us.. That\\'s for eu folks only. India doesn\\'t have GDPR. They fine them regularly and google pays the fine. That is in Europe, not India. Google can change their data mining clauses based on your location! I worked on GDPR compliance for a large business. Google is a data controller, which means they can collect the data of the users, through YouTube, Android, Chrome, publishers relations...all legally and with consent from the user. How many of you actually go into the settings and stop Google from personalizing ad experience? I mean we all want Google to tell us what time we should to catch the flight, right. \\nSo nope, Google is very much immune to GDPR.\\nIt\\'s the same with Facebook, they own the platforms and so they also own the data. The privacy concerns regarding advertising on Facebook are over blown and a case of by PR.\\n\\nBoth these companies are equally evil. They make money from mining your data and selling it to the highest bidder. Well then, with Facebook you get free social network, free communication, free video, free classifieds, free platform to connect with brands and businesses.\\n\\nBoth these companies are harvesting on data, it\\'s just a question of what you prefer. You prefer maps as an essential, there are people who prefer Instagram followers as essential or whatsapp call as essential or youtube videos as essential.\\n\\n90% of Google revenues and almost 100% of profit is from ads served by harvesting on your data, cause the product is free. Same is the case with Facebook. [deleted] VPN will safeguard you from DPI enforced by your ISP, but **not from the VPN provider**, so choose the trustworthy. Hmm, interesting. I guess then, if needed, a trained Data Scientist on behalf of ISP can easily create our digital fingerprint if not connected to VPN. All information have value. Thanks for the link & info. Yes but imagine if Drive becomes Dropbox? Only 2 GB free capacity. Reduced to one-seventh of current storage.\\n\\nI\\'m saying that our data is the price we should pay for using their services for free. If we do not want them to collect data, we should then start paying for Maps.\\n\\nThink about that. Ola and Uber and Swiggy and Zomato will be adding Map charges. We cannot confidently go to a new city and travel through those streets. It is only fair that they take something from us to provide an useful service. I appreciate your answer. It\\'s interesting, I\\'ll definitely read up more about it. Well you cant really use tor all the time , dear friend you never had any privacy in the first place. Private conversations and pictures is a different thing altogether though. We\\'re talking specifically about targetted ads. >Are you from a data harvester or work for jio?\\n\\nI\\'m just a college student who doesn\\'t earn yet. Poor sour ..i pity u brotha JioTV uses phone permission to determine if you\\'re on Jio network or not to carry the automatic login process🌝 trust but verify </3 GDPR has percentage penalty I think which made companies take it seriously. Flat penalties end up being cost of doing business for very big companies. but any european citizen traveling to india retains gdpr right? if you are traveling to EU, you also gain gdpr while in EU afaik. it is so hard to do it specifically for eu citizens that most of the tech companies have to offer gdpr related benefits to practically all users of their platform. (i might not be completely accurate here but gdpr has definitely improved online privacy of all web users in some way)\\n\\nthis is similar to anti spam laws in some countries. india does not have anything equivalent to the best of my knowledge but almost all legit mails we get have an unsubscribe option. coz they use mail delivery services who have to comply with can-spam type acts and it is easier to have it applicable for all customers instead of some. because you have no idea where the mails are actually going. I highly doubt they would do something like that. What does location even mean? Does a EU citizen travelling to India has their data mined? What about an Indian citizen who has settled in EU? What about EU citizens using non-EU VPN? What about non-EU users connecting via EU based VPN? Data mining based on location is going to open a big can of worms even Google wouldn\\'t be comfortable with. Do you have any sources for what you claim?\\n\\nEdit: Can downvoters explain why the downvote? Exactly the point, you have the option of stopping the data collection. Yea, I paused everything. Across google any reputable VPN is much better than facebook owned isp Yeah, great point. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if AI is already doing it. Yes, that is what my last sentence says. You just mixed up dogs and cats and called them a school of fish. That is how ads are targetted. Fb is the most notorious company which is known to do these kind of murky stuff. I don’t know why you down voted me, hoping that clears your notion on why not to take jio Running out of arguments? Well No they do that through an otp system\\nEdit: i was wrong > trust but verify\\n\\nLearnt about this quote after watching the Chernobyl Miniseries. Great one! Google or Facebook does not have data on your citizenship (they can guess, at most). Second, if a EU citizen travels to India, he or she is under the jurisdiction of Indian laws; which if allow data mining, would most definitely be legal. Likewise, if an Indian citizen travels to the EU, he is subject to the laws of the land.\\n\\nIf a non-EU user connects to an EU-based VPN, he is connecting to a network which is physically located inside EU, and will be subject to the laws and jurisdictions of the EU. If an EU citizen connects to a non-EU based VPN, he or she is using a service that is located and operated under the laws of the jurisdiction whose network and physical infrastructure of the said country.\\n\\nFor example, if someone connects to an EU server for searching torrents for pirated movies, the EU has the right to get the information about their activities, since it is illegal. If they find out that said person is not located within the physical boundaries of their jurisdiction, they have the right to inform the local authorities of the jurisdiction where the resident is physically located. Now, extend the same clause for something such as terrorism, child porn, drug trafficking etc. Then the matter is handed off to Interpol, and they have full rights to inform local authorities about such activities. Which browser and search engine do u use? How are you gonna connect to a vpn without an isp ? /s ;) Oh i wasn\\'t conflicting. Nope. We just want a bunch of free stuff. I\\'m saying it\\'s not gonna happen. As far as I have seen, the ads I see are about the things that I have searched on the internet. Never in my experience, ads were shown of the things I talked about in my private chat. I did not downvote you though. I don\\'t believe that downvote button is a disagree button.

No worries, neither was I :) Just thought you might have missed it. Friend whatsapp\\'s founder left FB and invested in signal for similar reasons. They know everything about you and they\\'ll show you the ads related to your chat so subtly that you wouldn\\'t even realise. Companies like FB also show you content from \\'pages\\' on FB to affect your \\'political affiliation\\'. Was curious and not necessary As long as you do things that don\\'t cross their laws. However, the said company (Google or Facebook for example) can hand over your information to the Indian authorities, since their data is mirrored in Indian locations, and thus you fall under the laws of the Indian jurisdiction.\\n\\nIn short, don\\'t do anything stupid that can get you in trouble; with or without a VPN.

Send the message through a friend or with a new phone number that you think she has stolen your laptop and you will file an FIR asap with her name.\\n\\nRemember - she is no friend. She is just trying to fck you over. Even if she agrees to return the laptop, tell her that your FIR will remain because you want your money back.\\n\\nTL:DR: Laptop is in your name, so she has just stolen your laptop. try /r/prorevenge to get ideas to pay her back. \"friend\"\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nWhat you do is you file a police complaint against her and I hope you have all the message records where she asks you for purchasing laptop against your credit card for some offer.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n>  I Ient online on netbanking but I couldn’t find any option for ongoing EMIs. \\n\\nWhere are you checking Credit card emi are generated each month. You won\\'t find it loan emi option. Dont swipe with dick. LoL so you just gave access to your card without even checking what exactly the offer was. \\n\\nPress F\\n\\n\\n Also the advice of filing a stolen laptop complaint on her name is a very solid strategy. Even before filing anything explain this to thana in-charge he will call and tell her father in detail what will happen next. Maybe she will cave in after that.....trust me you don\\'t want that EMI default on your credit history You\\'ve got a lot of good suggestions here, so I won\\'t add anything more but just tell me what kind of friend is this girl? For how many years do you know her? I usually make it a habit of not lending money to anyone who\\'s not earning well themselves (but comes from a well to do background). Is this girl earning well? File a FIR before she sues you of harrasment. If you have any proof show it to police and do it as soon as you can. EMI debts can fck you hard Also, you just made a dent in your credit history by skipping two EMIs. >She\\n\\nThe simp has fallen for the THOT again. *Ladki ka chakkar babu bhaiya* You\\'ve basically lost Rs 1 lakh unless she chooses to pay you back. You can\\'t pester her too much,there\\'s no evidence that you paid on her behalf,but she can file a harassment case on you which will cost you way more than a lakh to get rid of OP, contact her mom and dad. Don\\'t accuse their daughter of stealing. But say, \"Can you please help me. This has happened and I am in big trouble.  She is from such a good family, and I trust her. But for some reason, she is finding it difficult to pay me back. My bank balance is negative, and unlike your family, I cannot afford this. Please help me.\" \\n\\nApproaching people for help always is more successful than accusing them of not doing their part. This will save her dad\\'s face as well. \\n\\nContact her friends as well. I hope the pussy was worth it Lolwa.. try to contact her and record all conversations .. \\nYou might not get the money back but at least shame her on social media for the horrible stabbing she has done.       \\nAlso learn the following lesson for future. **If you are lending money to family or friends assume it will not be returned** That was a dumb move my friend. My friends use my cards in case of offers too but I give them access only one condition that they pay me upfront 100%\\n\\nYou can do just one thing. Police complaint with the bank statement as proof that amount is being deducted and also if the ecommerce account used was yours then the billing/shipping address should be your friend\\'s? (surely solidifies your claims in case of police complaint) My god. Learn from this. Trust no one but close family especially with money. Lol, women eh, just can’t say no. \\n\\nWell she turned you into a chump and I don’t think there is a solution to this unless and until she feels bad and gives u the money she “borrowed” from you. \\n\\nNext time, say no and don’t get floored by the sweet talk. Always think with ur brain and never with ur... u know the rest. Do you know where she lives? Go over and talk to her parents let\\'s see how they feel about this. If they also react negatively, go straight to the police with proof. Give her number to one of your friend.\\nTell him to call her and say that, \"you have filled a FIR against her\". Seems like you are \"young\" - first of all - do not let your CIBIL get fucked. The un-fucking of credit worthiness is a long hard road. So first of all beg, borrow or steal - but pay the bank and that your creditworthiness is maintained. \\nIf you can\\'t pay them, talk to them get deferment or something but do not pull the - It ain\\'t my fault stuff - It is yours. \\n\\nNext - the laptop is bought by you and belongs to you. You can not report stolen - as it is not. Legally, you gave it to her. You will have to find an intermediary, friend of a friend or some connection to reach out to her. \\n\\nLast resort is small claims court. \\n\\nYou see, she paid(has been paying) you for it - so there is no theft or intention of theft here. This is a case of small fraud, etc. \\n\\nI am not trying to judge you but since 14000 or so emi has put your account into negative, it is going to be tough. It is always tough for those without money to buy /seek / get justice. \\n\\nA relative pulled this shit on me. I paid up the EMIs, lesson learnt, like I say - stupidity is expensive. I would not ask you to stop your EMI, you\\'ll have to pay regardless, else your CIBIL is going for a toss. Which will cause major headaches if you ever need even a small loan. I wasn\\'t eligible for a car loan inspite of me having a decent income. \\n\\nI paid my EMIs on time, a technical error caused the bank to put me in a non payment list inspite of having cleared all EMIs. This was some 5 years ago and it came up when my CIBIL was checked for the car last year.\\n\\nToh, it becomes a major cause of concern if you block your card and stop payments. You need some solid advice on repayment of this EMI or brace up for no-loan eligibilty or ridiculous interest rates. \\n\\nThat\\'s my advice. Rest, you can seek professional advice on this. Try contacting her parents and respectfully ask for the money? If they know that you made the purchase for her then maybe they will give you the money if they are decent people. Otherwise filing a case against her seems like your best bet. You guys made a verbal contract and she breached it, contact a lawyer. Why are you ignoring the suggestions from people who are telling you to contact the parents if friend is ignoring your calls ? Looks like there is more to the problem than what is mentioned here Beta launde lag gaye! Ask your friends to call her or talk directly to her mom.\\nAs her mom was present there she could help.\\n\\nDon\\'t threaten them with an FIR, first FILE AN FIR at police station. And then threaten that you will file an FIR because women have a nuclear weapon called harassment which she might use.\\n\\n\\nIn case she puts harassment, you can ask for proof and you can tell I filled an fir so she had put an harassment case.\\n\\nI hope it won\\'t go this far.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso read a book \\'The Art of Saying No\\'. Involve common friends and family if you know any I don’t know what we can tell you here.  Contacting her is still your best bet. Try and find some common friends and contact her somehow. Tell her to pull some loan or something or even return the laptop if she can’t pay its installments. Loan is in your name so bank won’t help you at all. Gone case, if you still can’t reach her, and you have a regular salary coming in every month, try and get a loan and pay back that loan. Although that should be an absolute last resort and I would really not advise. And also, that would mean that laptop is yours then. Possession will be a problem though. File an FIR against your friend. Give police all the contact details you have. And the laptop should be recovered from her by police - which will prove your case.\\n\\nIf possible, use some other number or common friends to call her and tell her that you are filing an FIR against her. That\\'s it. Nothing more, don\\'t talk to her any more.\\n\\nFurther proof you can provide \\n- your WhatsApp messages where she asked you to pay for it (if you have the messages?)\\n- your payment details which show YOU paid for the laptop with your card\\n- devliery address (I am assuming it was her address where it was delivered directly)\\n- payment receipts of the last 2 payments that she sent you\\n\\nSo it will prove that you paid for laptop but it was delivered to her. And that she was paying you back, but it stopped. Yes. You are a victim. Why on earth would you do that? 😂 Just file a complaint for theft/ card misuse Feel sorry for OP.\\n\\nI have one golden rule for lending money - lend only if you are giving it as a gift. Which means you will be happy if they give back, else forget about it. Why don\\'t you block your card and send this dear friend a legal notice? Bruh simping cost you a ton This might be controversial but here me out. \\n\\nOpenly out her on public ... you say u have lot of mutual friends... just post it on social media...facebook, Twitter or Instagram and tag all your friends.\\n\\nOne thing rich people hate is to let others find out how cheap they really are. You will get your money with in a day.\\n\\nAlso, be nice and use polite words and mention that she might have forgotten about payments and since she isnt responding over phone you got to resort to this method. You do this to have an upper hand in this whole ordeal among your friends.... don\\'t ...aboslutely don\\'t do name calling or use harsh words. Put a fake apology at the end to really sell your victim story if that\\'s how u want to roll.\\n\\nGood luck and update us what happened. simp chuut ke chakkar... smh nvm If you knew that bitch is filthy rich beforehand, then that should have worked as a warning in itself. Why the fuck they need money from you if they already have more than the number of times you have took breathe so far in your life?\\n\\nBefore filing an F.I.R. tell her parents about what\\'s been going on. Later, when you do file one they would not be able to say \"Why didn\\'t you come to us first?!\"\\n\\nIf you do decide to talk to them, don\\'t threaten or anything. Keep a cool mind and aim to get your full money back, not the laptop. If things go your way, great! if not, file a F.I.R. immediately.\\n\\nAnd if I remember correct, there are ways by which you can block laptop but I think you need serial number and shit.\\n\\nMy father once said- \"When it comes to money, simply say you don\\'t have it or no. Relations could go sour either way. Atleast you would have your money in your pocket. What could be the worst that could happen? They won\\'t talk to you (but in most cases, things go to normal pretty quickly) but you\\'ve been living your life before meeting them, you can live without them also.\"\\n\\nHard to argue with his argument. \\n\\nPS. One more thing- YOU\\'VE BEEN RICK-ROLLED BUDDY! How long has she been ducking your calls? Perhaps she\\'s been grounded and can\\'t get to her phone? Did you try texting her on Facebook/Insta. Try to find out what you can from common contacts. Does any one you know stay close to her home? Try and contact her parents first too before you go for an FIR. I\\'m not sure how much you can undo an FIR after you filed one and I think having her name on FIR will ruin her life. All I\\'m saying is make super sure that she is actually stealing before you go to police. How close are you people ? Also never do there tricks again with anyone except close ones (family) If I was you I\\'d talk to her parents Ladki ka chakkar babu bhaiya. Why not call her parents and let them know of situation? Approach them on fb if no number is visible Ladki ka chakkar babu bhaiya ladki ka chakkar. Friendzone se niklne ka try kr rhe the bhaiya...scamzone me chale gye since you say her mother was also with you while purchasing, try contacting her, it might be that your \"friend\" might be getting monies from home to pay you, but might have other ideas about that You were stolen from. Get off reddit and raise a police complaint ASAP. Call your bank, go through the annoying 1 hour of wait time and lodge a dispute on the payment. Do these things quickly.\\n\\nDon\\'t give your bank account password to \"friends\". This is what banks repeated warn people about.\\n\\nYou will need to pay sufficient bribes to the police before they\\'ll take your complaint probably, but you deserve that for being a dumdum. This is why you always deny EMI requests on your credit cards from your friends, no matter how good the friend is or how good the offer is. \\n\\nApart from the problem that you faced (people deliberately cheating), they can even come under financial/ life difficulties in the future and thus are unable to pay you back. Another thing to note here is that EMI blocks your credit, this might be really bad if you need the emergency credit in times like these. Big EMI amounts also affect your CIBIL score negatively.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t mean you cannot help your friends with your credit cards, just ask them to pay up within a day after you purchase something for them simp Tell us more about this friend Not a friend. Should come under \"Illegaltips\" , why not hire or bribe someone to steal that laptop from her ?\\n\\nreading from your replies ,it seems you cant do anything , atleast get it back , remove all teh hardware , part by part and sell it and deny her , if at all she comes to you , of any wrong doing and force her to repay her debt.. Why assume the worst? Play it like you genuinely care for her. Make a facebook public post expressing concern that you are worried for her as she\\'s not answering your calls and messages. Tell her that you\\'ll pay for the EMI yourself for now till she\\'s back on her feet as it looks like she\\'s fallen into some tough times but to just tell that she\\'s alright as you\\'re getting worried by the day. She will definitely respond if she\\'s got even some amount of sense of social standing. Sin people do to enable  nature to wipe out human race . [deleted] zero cost emi?? SIMP. Stop the EMI and they will take the laptop back (from her)\\n\\nEdit - apparently I don\\'t know how EMI works. I can’t go to the store right now, every thing is in strict lockdown. The store isn’t even open to have a phone call. \\n\\nAnd I’m not sure going to the police is a good idea. Her father is a big figure and has lots of connections. Considering that she is from a much better financial background than me is why I hesitatingly accepted. Can\\'t file fir with wrong info. Better send a legal notice via Registered post. This might work if she used your account to order the laptop. I haven’t ever purchased anything on EMI, so I don’t have any idea how it works. \\n\\nIs it like the amount to the store is already paid and we are just paying back the bank now? Will it help if I just freeze my account after explaining the bank about my problem? Slightly offtopic but just curious.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat happens when there\\'s a default on your credit history? She comes from a financially solid family. Has an amazing home with a pool and one of the best views in the city. Her family has quite a few luxury cars. So in my mind I thought there was no way she is trying to cheat me for a laptop and really just wants it for the offer. \\n\\nShe befriended me around 3 years ago in our final year of college and I feel the only reason for that was because she was crushing on my best friend. So she wasn’t really a friend of mine, more like acquaintances and we belonged to the same social circle. Never did just the two of us hung out. We only met when there were others around. \\n\\nAnd her mom was with her too when she was making the purchase of the laptop so it comforted me more knowing that her extremely wealthy family knows about this purchase. \\n\\nShe is still doing her Masters as of now, not earning salary whereas I am self employed and trying to be financially independent since the last 2 years now. If the amount got deducted from my account how does it affect my credit history? It’s not like the payment was delayed. Please be respectful. Just because it\\'s a girl doesn\\'t mean you have use such disgusting words Thank you Chut ka chakkar, maut se takkar Okay that kind of scares me. I have a few evidences on chat sharing screenshots of how much balance got cut and she replying back that she has paid that amount. > No evidence you paid on her behalf\\n\\n....the charges are on his bank account? Most probably her parents( one or either both) would be also like that ...\\nValues come by upbringing. A formal legal notice will do. Trust no one, not even close family! I am off the view that any money loaned to friends or relatives should be considered as a gift.\\n\\nOnly part with as much money as you can afford to give as a gift. Is there a way to check the CIBIL score online?\\n\\nE: I checked it via a website of the same name. Like I said I have never taken an EMI or a loan before, my score stands in the second top tier (light green). Does everyone start with 900 score? WTF why!!! I am self-employed and all my work has been stopped for a while now. \\n\\nAnd I really don’t want to get into another loan, I don’t like the interest schemes and plans. \\n\\nI can always ask my parents for some boost but that completely negates the point of being financially independent. [deleted] Wise words.. Haha, nothing like that. She was just a good friend from college days who used to hit on my best friend. That’s how she befriended me actually. what the fuck man You can\\'t stop EMIs. Definitely not how it works How big of a figure could he even be, if she couldn’t even afford the laptop without availing some discount offers ? If she is from a financially sound family, why did you use your card without taking the money from her first ? Also, never lend someone an amount that you can\\'t live without, even if it is your best friend. Filing an FIR is the best option if she has blocked you. Worst case, learn from this and move on. In the short term - schmoozing is your first and best bet. Try to get a friend to call for you and beg.  \\n\\nAt the same time, try to get as much information as possible (Serial number. mac address) etc. Even if store is closed, the vendor (Apple/Lenovo/DELL) etc. may have information they can provide you, because you are the customer. You are paying for it. \\n\\nElse, one day or the other, the store will open and you will get the info. Basic things that will help you prove possession include serial number, mac address (anywhere outside she connects to the wifi, it will be recorded e.g. at starbucks).  \\n\\nThe fact that you it is from your account makes it yours regardless of what she says unless she has some thing from you saying you have gifted it to her. \\n\\nAfter you have enough information, contact the dad directly. 1L is not a big amount for big people considering the amount of pain this can cause them. Call her dad. Straight up she\\'ll get into major shit.\\nIndian parents. If her father is a big figure find his number and talk to him. Chances are he doesn\\'t know his child is being a shit-head and would like to settle the matter rather than drag it out. If he\\'s a decent guy it\\'ll be alright else if the seed doesn\\'t fall to far away from the tree, you\\'re screwed. Well - it would be \\'stolen\\' because she has taken it from him and she is not returning it. It was an in-store purchase and she used my card to avail the offer. Now your credit score will get fucked as well. Don\\'t expect any loans either. If you have pay through credit card EMI bank pays on your behalf and you pay back the bank amount plus interest minus discount. Credit card emi are generated each month with that emi and any other purchase made in that month.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIs your credit card set to auto pay? How did your account balance went negative? How was the purchase made, credit card, debit card emi or some other shit ? You can\\'t block the card and run away. You are stupid . That girl and bank is not. You get goons in your house asking for money. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve been there. 1.) They charge you a intrest rate anywhere better 35-50%/Month. \\n\\n2.) It becomes very difficult to get any future loan you might actually need on good Intrest rates. Be it home, car or education loan\\n\\n3.) They send collection agents to your house, work and even your relatives place just to embarrass you into paying Well, try the other suggestions above but two things your should always keep in mind:\\n\\n1. Never lend money to someone who themselves can\\'t pay for it. Don\\'t look at family money, because unless you\\'re a bank you can\\'t pressurise their family to give the money back.\\n\\n2. Always remember, acquaintances are not friends.\\n\\n\\nI think she\\'s trying to delay the payment. Maybe her mom is paying her to give you the money but she\\'s simply stealing it. First, try contacting her and then her mom. You do know her mom I presume. > She comes from a financially solid family. Has an amazing home with a pool and one of the best views in the city. Her family has quite a few luxury cars. \\n\\nIs gathering few friends and doing tamasha at her home in front of her parents and neighbours an option? \\n\\nAnd never, I mean never, lend anyone money unless you truly trust them. Try the following :\\n\\n1. Grab mutual friends and explain it to them, peer pressure from all of her friends will beat her into coming out.\\n\\n2. If that doesn’t work, April 20th allows you to travel alone for essential services, if she’s stay nearby or within the same district: get on wheel to her place and explain this shit to her parents.\\n\\n3. This is the last option: File an FIR. State that you have been a victim of fraud and she is now scammed you. The police ideally would come to a truce without court.\\n\\n4. If none of the above work, or you have no for seeable outcome, you SHOULD NOT defame a person for this. Go legally. Gather evidence that you have tried to reach out to her, paid the EMIs, That this wasn’t a GIFT to her, ANY FORM of evidence that she has used your sentiments and bought it out of your account for that sole purpose.  \\n\\nI bid you best of Luck > And her mom was with her too when she was making the purchase of the laptop so it comforted me more knowing that her extremely wealthy family knows about this purchase.\\n\\nDid her mom know that you are lending her the money , she probably probably her that it was a gift from you . find her mother on fb? or true caller? Your bank will report that your savings/current account got negative. Abey chutiye har jagah same comment kr raha, paise lekr bhaag gyi laundiya...ab kya aarti utar kr devi ka post de de use. But it do be like that Uncle please sit down Let\\'s use gender neutral curse words from now on bois Yes that would help , save it and go to police. You may or may not get money back in the long run but the bank will deduct money as per schedule.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nTwo installments made your Bank balance go negative. Why did you okay someone to make purchase of 140000 with 30 k as saving.\\n\\nI am sorry my comments are of no help and are starting to turn in rant but seriously I don\\'t even know you and I am angry at you. I don\\'t think you should take this comment seriously. He said there\\'s no evidence you paid on her behalf but the charges are on your account. Right, there is evidence he paid the amount, and that the lady has a laptop. But atleast in the main post there\\'s no evidence that he paid on her behalf and that she has to pay him back. Even if escalated to police,she may as well say the laptop was a gift to get [deleted] No. Send her a legal notice. Talk to the laptop seller and see if he can do something. Shame her on social media? Being Financially independent is good but when things are worst. I\\'d suggest you ask your parents for that boost. Afterall Parents raised us and are the most important people. OP ke reply read karo jara It looks like that in this case at the very least. Oh ok. Thank God I don\\'t have to deal with EMI, you see I am rich\\n\\nEdit - can\\'t believe I have to explain this, it was sarcasm \"Mera paas bahut paisa hai\" take a chill pill guys You\\'ll be surprised. it doesn;t work that way, big people can royally screw over regular people over little things Everyone likes discounts but I doubt someone who is very well off would opt for EMI on a laptop OP sounds like a guy, and lent money to a \\'close\\' friend who happens to be a girl.\\n\\nWe do stupid things in such circumstances. Almost same thing happened to me and this is the best advice man! I had to do the same Truth, if you\\'re gonna lend money to a friend you should think of it as giving them money without expecting it to be returned. Otherwise don\\'t lend money to friends unless you secretly hate them and now it\\'s a good chance to end your friendship with them. She bought the laptop from her account. So it is her property. She borrowed money from OP and did not return. It is a case of cheating. What is a really bad credit score? And what is the score if there are no EMIs or Loans to be paid back? \\n\\nI checked my CIBIL score and it is in the second tier (light green). But i am still not around 900 so could it be because of negative balance my score dropped? It was a debit card EMI. So the EMI got debited and my account already had low balance so it went into negative. \\n\\n>\\tyou are stupid \\n\\nI don’t really doubt that right now. Can confirm .. happened to a \\'girl friend\\' .. they will send goons and they are scary.. No you haven\\'t Where do they get all those details? I live not in my hometown so no relatives around and my parents don’t even live in the country. It wasn’t actually lending money, she was supposed to pay back the amount before it gets deducted. I told her I dont usually have a lot of money in my account and she assured me it wont happen. You account balance has no effect on your credit ratings whatsoever. The girls only do 2 things man. Drink chai and lie At the time of purchase I had around 50k of savings and just in this lockdown situation I have no business, my parents will definitely help me but idk how to explain the situation where I don’t come out as stupid. This. Basically taking a loan that one can\\'t pay back, doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s on behalf of someone else He said that there are screenshots of the chat where she\\'s paying back the EMI when OP messaged her about the charges. She won\\'t be able to claim it\\'s a gift after that. not at all during sales . Especially not yourself Do you\\'ve 2 fortuners?? Good.. for you? Dekhiye r/india ki janta, koi aise bhi log hote hai. \"I\\'d tell you, but then I\\'d have to kill you\" I’m sorry to say this, but I think the OP simped Such a cheap mentality. Not every relationship between guy and girl is like that actually. Debit card EMI are deducted automatically as per amortization schedule.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nFIR Sure. As you say. We have phones my dude if they cant reach them physically they will call....and call again\\n\\nThose debt collectors are literally gundas hired by banks its a grey area when it comes to legality. But they will find out trust.\\n\\nThere was thread a week back where OP\\'s friend was contacted by one such collector because he missed just one EMI. the motive was to malign his image in his friend circle. I will link the thread if i could find it here.\\n\\nEDIT : Found it!  \\n\\n\\n  [https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eo3mqp/can\\\\_debt\\\\_collectors\\\\_tell\\\\_other\\\\_people\\\\_like\\\\_family/](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eo3mqp/can_debt_collectors_tell_other_people_like_family/) That\\'s just lending money with extra steps lmao. Does someone owe you money? That\\'s lending regardless of the method. So this won’t affect my CIBIL score? I signed up on CIBIL and my rating is in the second tier (light green). Idk if it dropped after the EMI or was it always like this. But they have all details, like my credit card, debit card, the loan application, all information. Kinda scary. It does if it causes an EMI bounce. Ok incel. Bro just explain it doesn’t matter how you look take this as a lesson and never forget the person who put you in this place and chill everything will be ok You can\\'t explain this situation to anyone without coming off as stupid. Ah.. didn\\'t see that in the original post, looks like he added it in a comment later. I would still be hesitant to escalate too much given the accusation of harassment risk, but the screenshots may save him True, I would spend all my money on Nifty puts I am rich as in content with what I have calm down nav What\\'s in the cannister? r/unexpectedrainbow6 But most of them are.\\n\\nExceptions are not the norm.\\n\\nCheap or not. Truth is truth. lmao @ downvotes. So freezing my account will only further damage me? What if I report my card is stolen? Your bank account balance has absolutely no effect on your cibil score. I have 3 saving accounts and most of the time my balance is near zero or even in negative (dont mind paying the charges for non maintenance of balance as the offers on the banks balance it out). But i have a car loan and 3 credit cards and i have never missed a emi or CC bill due date. So am able to maintain the score above 800 (many banks wont even consider a loan application with score below 750 or charge you a higher ROI). So beg, borrow or steal but somehow pay the EMIs on time, missing even one due date will fare badly on your credit report. We need something like r/dalalstreetbets to be more active Ahaaa Asked that cause CarryMinati once said \"I\\'m rich I\\'ve 2 fortuners\" Not really. Maybe it\\'s what you have experienced You will have bigger problems if you try to pull that shit on banks Dude don\\'t do this shit. Its fraud. If you do this, then getting money back from your friend would be the least of your problems. Okay, one last thing. The EMI is automatically debited from my account on the date. So I don’t have to take any extra steps to make sure it’s all right, right? /r/indianstreetbets is this way Oh, sorry I don\\'t know who she is '},\n",

This is cheap labor. Basically this is a means to exploit the poverty in India, while it does little to nothing to bring people out of poverty. Sure it\\'s a baby step to continue to build the economy but China actually had a government that used it\\'s cheap manufacturing based economy as a stepping stone to diversify and create real global players in various sectors. I don\\'t know if it can be done in India with the divisive political games that are constantly being played. Articles like these appear everytime a crisis happens involving China. It\\'s so stupid. Even Tesla was \\'planning\\' to start a gigafactory came to India. It did not. They will mull production in India. Create a feasibility plan, will factor in our land laws, labor laws and run away. Not with the labour and land laws currently in india. We need to liberalise labour laws , any ways the private companies fire workmen whenever they want under the radar by the means of 3rd party contractors , beter to make it simple for them to fire and hire. Directly hired by companies are better because the employees can have better benefits not get into traps of shady contractors\\n\\nAnd also if a company buys a land and then wastes next 10 years in litigation filed by some ngo proped up by the opposition party not gonna attract any companies These businesstoday, indiatoday sites block me from coming back to reddit by pressing back after I have read the article. What is this - bad programming or am I doing something wrong? I\\'m on mobile btw. I wish we were ready for this. I wish so much. India Superpower 2020? I think so! SE Asia is where all of these will go. India is not a good place for Business. Running a business in India is such a huge clusterfuck. In the name of making economy better I hope they don\\'t create/amend laws to incorporate these new industries which affects our environment negatively. Such articles appear every season. Never materialize. Comparing Gurgaon to Shenzen is delusional. Ease of doing business. I hope govt makes use of this opportunity. Apne Muh miya mithoo. American here but yes, get your jobs out of China. It’ll be better for your economy in the long run. China is willing to bribe it’s way out of the situation. Most of the companies will take Chinese money and will stay evil a few companies with some morals remaining will shift away from China I fear this is further going to escalate land ownership issues, indigenous people displacement. Wildlife & environment will go to dogs. Not to mention escalation in pollution. We may gain something, however end up losing a lot!. Some sarkari babu will be so happy making life miserable for firangis. we missed it during lockdown of january why they will coe to india now Fuck everytime Modi is getting lucky.

I\\'m thinking it\\'ll end up going to other countries. \\n\\nIt\\'s usually the laws and ease of operations that attracts foreign businesses. China accomplish this through shady labour laws. People like to pretend that manufacturing can just be attracted by offering good policies or low taxes\\n\\nNope. Manufacturing in the present time is all about logistics and labor. \\n\\nIndia might be able to get the labor laws, but it is years away from the infrastructure necessary for China-tier manufacturing Vietnam is well poised actually. >we step up and take advantage of this\\n\\nlike we did during US China trade war? and with Modi at helm? lol Exactly what i have been waiting to hear for so long (2 weeks) Seeing how govt killed online deliveries under the pressure of traders union vote bank. I second this. How about retroactive taxes?

Eventually nothing materialised.\\n\\n> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a4076f/how_foxconn_cons_governments_and_taxpayers_around/ Definitely not. China was only able to do that through the Party and solidified political system. India will always suffer since it believes the West is somehow on their side. Economically India will be used and abused (similar to farmers and Monsanto GMO crops) by these companies and then they\\'ll move elsewhere when cheaper production is available. Vietnam, Bangladesh, soon enough places like Cambodia and Myanmar. Bullshit. Most of this labor right now is in even worse jobs with even more uncertainty - farmhands, construction site workers, etc.\\n\\nA factory job where they can live in the factory compound and get paid monthly is a massive step up from their current situation\\n\\nRemember all those stories about workers committing suicide at Foxconn\\'s plants? They didn\\'t mention that Foxconn\\'s largest plant literally has nearly 500,000 people living together in \"Foxconn City\". With that many people, suicides are bound to happen for non-work related issues too. And the number of suicides within the city was far lower than the suicide rate for the larger population Modern Colonialism. To be fair Tesla is on another level in terms of manufacturing. India can still be home to a lot of other lower level manufacturing It\\'s their mistake for not paying the necessary bribes though. I follow Elon Musk very close as he is my role model, Tesla never planned a factory in India\\n\\nStop lying Unfortunately, you are probably right. The only way we can suceed is via what the chinese did, create an authorotarian technocracy(not BJP or congress but different). If we don\\'t homogonise like the Americans did after the civil war we are fucked. For me it opens a Chrome browser inside reddit. I can return by pressing back. I\\'m on mobile too. Open in new tab Bad programming. Double click the back button. IMO they do this by adding another page that links to the actual article. Lol. Just look at the example of AP, government changes and all policies and regulations change; bribes have to be paid to new ministers and babu\\'s; every 5 years you have a loss of continuity about how business will be. >I feel like the country won\\'t capitalise.\\n\\nThey won\\'t. The bribe culture of this country combined with the corrupt sanghi government will not do much good when it comes to matter such as these. However, starting communal riots, wasting money, that always works. Tell me more about Labour laws in India. Not exactly. It\\'ll be a self-sustaining cycle, especially in a scenario where companies are moving out despite the price. Once a robust manufacturing SEZ or multiple SEZs have been set up, private investment will pour in and government infrastructure would build around it increase capacity. \\n\\nThat\\'s why now is the chance, because companies are looking to move. Online deliveries of what? For what it\\'s worth Foxconn does have 2 assembly units in india .. iphone 8 is made in india ..we are way behind china but yes I hope India can take some  advantage of the situation ..would help the slumped economy a lot I\\'d wager Africa after they\\'ve run out of places in SEA. Logistically closer to the West, cheap labor, rife with corruption and chock-full of natural resources. There\\'s a reason why China\\'s going full ham trying to farm as much as they can out of it. tesla could have easily set up manufacturing in India. India\\'s policies made them want to go to china, a country which doesn\\'t respect copyright etc it wasn\\'t about bribes. it was about the 30% sourcing from local market rules. Musk kept telling Modi that let us set up first, we\\'ll eventually comply as Indian ecosystem of supply part exist.\\n\\nbut no. Modi said he started Make in India so it came to him as a surprise that Elon says there is no parts ecosystem in India. role model, what a joke. lol when tesla was going to start its first gigafactory in India, union ministor Gadkari had gone to Cali to convince him to start gigafactory in India and make \"India the manufacture hub for asia\"\\n\\nthen Modi\\'s ridiculous policies came into the picture and thus gigafactory went to China + due to MOdi\\'s ridiculous policies, Tesla still hasn\\'t done entry in INdia.\\n\\nif you really follow Elon on twitter then you should know this, else you are a fraud and you don\\'t know shit that you are talking about.\\n\\ngoogle is your best friend. Corruption is not that relevant to economic development, there is research which suggests that sometimes it has a positive boost in the explosive growth phase of an economy. It only becomes a massive problem after a while once it\\'s positives aren\\'t balancing out the negatives. \\n\\nIndia\\'s wages situation (contrary to popular assumptions it is not that cheap relative to many other places), bureaucratic processes like ease of doing business, infrastructure(doesn\\'t just means roads, it means everything from roads, rail, public transport, telecom, internet ports, real estate, factories, trucking/freight etc), literacy rates of the work-force and Govt policy flexibility in adapting to changing tides globally. \\n\\nThese will determine the outcome. The most nimble, flexible, adaptable will survive the best. Those who are slow, dogmatic will suffer. Nah, he’s right. \\n\\nYou are not really responding to his point anyway, so just to explain the issue-\\n\\nI met a foreigner who was considering other countries to do do MFG. his view on India was that other than the major multinationals, there was a dearth of capacity and sophistication in the firms here. So if he had to get something built as a medium sized firm, he just wouldn’t find the right kind of people to help him get up to speed in time.\\n\\nHowever, other countries like Vietnam were doing a much better job, and so were now also attractive destinations for manufacturing. \\n>Once a robust manufacturing SEZ or multiple SEZs have been set up\\n\\nwe\\'ve had sezs before corona.check how they\\'re being utilized. No, you can have infra later but labor, land laws are something that need to be favorable from day 1. Non essential items Yeah my post and the linked podcast elaborates how Foxconn promises huge projects, takes benefits based on those and then sets up something quite small. Which basically screws the government/people because similar local businesses don\\'t enjoy those benefits. So you harm the local businesses and also get less taxes/money from Foxconn (they manage to negotiate free land!).\\n\\nWhy do politicians bend backwards to do this? Because it gives them fancy headlines, which sways public opinion. Listen to the podcast, one of the best journalistic pieces I\\'ve heard. Yeah but with the amount China puts into it the West will have a harder time breaking into it. The way my African friends put it is China doesn\\'t care about Africa, as no nation does, but China doesn\\'t pretend to care. They build infrastructure that\\'s mutually beneficial but not for the sake of Africa like the West has claimed to do across the global south for centuries. To each his own! Chutiya so that is government wooing Tesla, soch toh le type karne ke pehle\\n\\nWhere did Tesla respond to any of those efforts by saying \\'We are planning to open factory in India\\'\\n\\nIf I go and tell Disha Patani I want you to have sex with me, it doesn\\'t mean that *she was planning to have sex with me* Sure, but wage rate is actually not a clincher, and I at least feel like economists globally give it a disproportionate amount of attention. Wages as a quantum of total cost is only around 10% or so. Land is actually the bigger deal, and without land reforms, I don\\'t feel like any major corporate would want to manufacture in India. Look at the Bullet train... Modi\\'s pet project, so much media spotlight, and in spite of all the bureaucratic pressure, diplomatic pressure and everything, they still literally can\\'t even acquire land to build the damn thing! Land reform is critical and labour reform comes second, imv. Thanks. Just how cheap is Indian labor after factoring in all these invisible costs vs China and rest of LOw cost countries (Vietnam, bangladesh, China). Take any industry of your choice operating a plant at optimum utilisation levels. everytime there is a indo-chinese thread I find u..whats the fetish > there is research which suggests that sometimes it has a positive boost in the explosive growth\\n\\nWhen you have to pay millions and billions of dollars in bribes to netas just to start your business in India, I do think it has a massive effect. Not that the other things you mentioned don\\'t have an impact but one of the reasons why China is  a major manufacturing hub is that any mid size company from the US or EU can simply walk into a Chinese sweatshop and get their products made. Here there is a string of babus you have to pay bribes to in order to even start your business. In this description, it does make sense. \\n\\nGuess we\\'ll have to have a ground up reformation of tax and labor laws within a few months, which sounds too much for this government. Again, have a look at the circumstances, there are initiatives this time around to move production to other countries. I\\'m not denying th fact that the government needs to step up here but there is a good opportunity to change our sectors this time around. The overall goal would be to reduce costs, but in this scenario, cost reduction happens with\\n1. Government funding (Japan\\'s 2 billion dollar plan)\\n2. Decreased cost due to increased infrastructure spending.\\n\\nThis would offset the land and labor costs FOR THE TIME BEING but we\\'ll have to make favorable conditions soon enough. Will do thanks for the sharing [removed] Absolutely spot on. \\n\\nLast i checked development wage rate was a few years back and even then India was not the cheapest, it was sort of mid-pack with places like Vietnam having far cheaper levels.  \\n\\nThe bit about Land you rightly point out is even more relevant and India already had more expensive Real Estate than China because India has had a longer time for the land-market to develop organically (to a large extent) while in China due to their internal politics land market only opened up in last 2 decades and only few years back did a few of their Tier 1 cities even match Indian Metros. \\n\\nElsewhere in other cities India is still more expensive to get land. I\\'ve written a lot on the Land Reforms bit and how no country in history developed or made it without first having them.  \\nWritten a lot about HSR as well, land acquisition and speed of that has now turned out of the biggest impediment to its quick completion. And MAHSR was just 1 of like 6 corridors that were planned in 2009. We\\'re already late, 1 HSR line ain\\'t enough we need our entire passenger system to be on HSR as quickly as possible. Well I am well informed on the subject matter and it is only natural one would make comments on things they know about. China has massive levels of corruption like one you list pre mid 2010s when anti-corruption campaign went into overdrive.  \\nHaving local officials bribed to speed through the red tape enhanced productivity because business creation gets a boost and with a ready market the overhead of the original bribe or even later small ones are easily absorbed because the growth itself is so massive. \\n\\nIt though becomes a problem when growth slows over time (as happens in all developed places) and the overhead becomes less and less viable expense hence starts to become an impediment to business creation and thus growth cycle itself.  \\n\\nCorruption and Competence are not necessary to be separate, they can co-exist. Even a body like FIFA, highly corrupt (less so now) but was still highly competent in what its job was. \\n\\nCorruption this is a later order issue, more important ones have higher propriety. Costs but also stability. Manufacturing is contractual now, this means everything downstream MUST be contractual including labor. Our current laws will not allow such a buisness model to work. You think I am a Sanghi lol, just shows you don\\'t have brains\\n\\nI have zero fucks to give about Right wing assholes, but I don\\'t make up BS claims about Tesla planning to opening factories in India, stop reading  everything on whatsapp > we need our entire passenger system to be on HSR as quickly as possible.\\n\\nhow will we get the money? Already pre COVID 19 our economy was shit. Budget for basic infrastructure is tight. Converting entire passenger system would take trillions of dollars right? Besides unfortunately this government doesn\\'t seem to that kind of visionary or anything.\\n\\nAnd what do you think we should do about land? never saw you on r/china, just saying! [removed] I wrote about this like 5 years back and then a few years later re-edited the [comment over here](https://np.reddit.com/user/iVarun/comments/73txpy/hsr_in_india_part_i/). \\n\\nMoney is *generally* there, it will be financed like how everyone does Infra-boom development, through Debt. Because this is Public good it pays for itself overtime multiple folds over. \\n\\nJust imagine the Positive overhead value of Indian Railways in purely economic terms (ignore the reality of its social exploitation on a country wide scale for a moment). The figure is basically incalculable. You can not calculate what the positive of people who will be saving hours on their journey does to the productivity and even psychology of the person and then the wider populace. It has cascading level effects. \\n\\nAnd it will now cost Trillions but had this been started 20 years ago it would have only cost few 100s of Billions. Meaning the longer we wait the more expensive it will be, even after accounting for just general level inflation. \\n\\nAlso India had/has already undertaken to \"Upgrade\" the existing Railways infra by funneling in 100s of Billions over next decade. This is such a waste of resource. There is a limit to how much one can prop up a 2-3 century old tech-platform. Of course it will run(so old isn\\'t an impediment in itself) since so much money is being throw at it but it is wasteful because there is a ceiling to how much efficient that spending is.  \\n\\n\\nLand angle is basically the biggest issue. I don\\'t have a satisfactory answer for that and i doubt anyone has. No country in history has achieved progress and high development status without having Land Reforms. I don\\'t see why India would be the lone outlier (it could but then there needs to be an explanation for why it would be so). \\n\\nAs I stated in the linked post above, there is no place on the face of this Earth which is better suited to HSR than India. None compare, not even China. I used to be a regular there since around 2011-12 till 2016 when I left for good. It was already a disaster of a sub but it was getting more ridiculous by mid 2010s and time has shown since then that it\\'s gotten even worse as I suspected it would. \\n\\nThere is no single place on reddit where one can go and be better informed on subject of China. Best one can hope for is some critical insight happening organically on some comment chain on some post on just about any sub. cleantechnica.com\\nWeb results\\nTesla Gets An Invite To Set Up Factory In Tamil Nadu, India\\n\\nhttps://fossbytes.com/tesla-gigafactory-india-wont-be-a-reality-any-time-soon/amp/\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/india/1680485/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-be-unaffordable-in-india-due-to-duty/amp/\\n\\nhttps://www.ibtimes.com/will-tesla-set-factories-india-anytime-soon-dont-count-it-2880255\\n\\nBata isme se where does Elon even give a hint for Tesla Gigafactory? > No country in history has achieved progress and high development status without having Land Reforms.\\n\\nBut what does land reform mean specifically? Is it just redistribution of agriculture land to tillers/tenants or making it easier for capitalists to acquire it? Because both are seen differently at opposite spectrum right? And why did we fail at land reforms. Is it due to democratic form of governance? If so there isn\\'t much hope right now is it? If it hasn\\'t changed for decades, how likely is it to change now? Land Reform as you rightly bring up means a lot of little things combined, it can\\'t just mean 1 unitary/exclusive thing because if so it wouldn\\'t have been that hard for everyone. \\n\\nHowever redistribution is a major part of it. And critically there is a spectrum to this, meaning it doesn\\'t mean it has to be redistributed Absolutely equally all over the country to the 99.9% degree or something. The important bit is that there is some fairness involved and redistribution is generally equitable that even if some end up with more it is not so much more that the entire point of redistribution is defeated to begin with. \\n\\nNow China did this by force in many places, took the land from rich affluent land owners and gave it to the workers, peasants (usually through communes but there was flexibility, meaning it doesn\\'t need to be 1 way and only 1 way to do this, important thing is to do it). \\n\\nEven today, per-capita land size ownership in China is even smaller than India (its about equal but if one accounts for regional conditions a lot more Indians own more land per person than a regular Chinese does). \\n\\nHere is an [excellent comment on S Korea experience](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5vqk2v/how_did_south_korea_become_such_a_powerhouse/de4agzb/) on how they went about this and their economic progress.  \\n\\nIndia passed Land Reform policy in 50s but left it to the States to implement (like it did a lot of things which were politically too challenging), Kerala and WB did the most with it and it could be seen in the progress they made (WB was among the best economically performing states for many decades before Communist Govt apathy there entered stagnation). \\n\\nLand Reform also means imminent domain guidelines. Because land is public entity essentially and it is required for public goods depending on what new developments happen in different era it becomes paramount for the State to utilize that land, even by force if necessary. Greater good trumps individual liberty here. This doesn\\'t mean the owner gets nothing, they should be properly compensated but they shall not be allowed to hijack the project for what are ultimately emotional needs. Which though important do no trump the material Plus emotional needs for far too many which will come over subsequent generations. \\n\\nAnd history has shown that to be the case in India. Over 400-500 Million people perished in India from 1950-2005 without seeing development, these people died in poverty basically. This has already happened, these people are gone. One can\\'t just ignore them as pure statistics. They happened to live once and how they lived matters. We failed because our system couldn\\'t provide for them what it was build for, what all Govts/States are built for.\\n\\n\\nRegarding change now. The current Govt did introduce a new Land Bill, but it deals primarily with parts of the Land Reform relating to acquisition, compensation and the redistribution angle is left untouched basically (because no politician in India has the balls to even utter the words let alone write it down in some bill). \\n\\nI suspect the hope of Govt planners are that since economy with shift away from Primary sector it means less pressure on Land for agricultural purposes and thus ease the pressure on that front. But this to me is naive thinking. Manufacturing is not going to reach 30-40% of the economy and services are subject to high automation. Indian Agri sector is going to have a massive proportion of people for decades and this matters because this era is basically when our Demographic Dividend is happening as well. Sorry to be needlessly opaque. Land reform not in that sense, but in the sense of reforms to the land acquisition process. Essentially there are a lot of clauses in land buying right now, which are important so that rich people and big companies don\\'t fuck over the mostly poor and financially illiterate farmers. These include things like enhanced acquisition cost, I.e. land cost will be manifold of actual value. Second, most projects require 100s of acres, and given land holdings are so small, that means 1000s of farmers may have to sell land for such enterprise. In India, the rule is that 80% of the farmers within that area must accede to land acquisition so that the acquisition can actually take place. What this does is it creates an environment rife for politicking and disruption, where lots of mala fide elements like politicians can go and scare the farmers into rioting for more money. Look at Mamata Bannerjee and Singur case.\\nModi govt. tried in the 1st term to tackle land reform, but widespread protests from opposition, farmers etc. forced them to back down. Personally, I have low hopes that this country will ever reform the land acquisition process... if a government with brute majority can\\'t do it, then God knows. I\\'ve heard that individual states like Andhra (with Chandrababu) had innovative techniques for acquisition during Amaravati land acquisition, but still.... our land costs something like 10x what land does in Europe or USA.... such investments for a company are ridiculous.

       "  'comments': \"Question - Oil price has gone down drastically. Does this mean petrol and diesel prices would be reduced for consumers? So does that mean, we would see a drastic drop in petrol prices or just that our Oil Companies stop buying petrol for sometime? And Assam increased tax on petrol. It is now 5 rupees costlier. Oil supply agreements are based on hedging. That is future contracts wherein it is stated that a particular commodity will be purchased on a specific price only no matter what the orignal price of commodity is in the future. This contract is done to avoid the effect of price changing due to market conditions. Its a good thing 🤔  renewable energy goes down the drain i suppose And we are sure aiming for Rs. 100 per liter for petrol. Petrol price in india has been at around 73Rs for months. The crude oil prices has fallen a to zero. The government and petroleum companies are in this together.  Then the crude oil price increase the petrol price increases . When the crude oil price goes down. Government and petroleum companies make more profit. Look this does mean that you can go to a petrol station and get free gas. Learn about derivatives. A bunch of traders sold a ton of contracts for really low prices. Since these contracts expired on the 21st that's why you saw the prices. Once the contracts expire you can do a bunch of things but most likely you will take a physical delivery of the good. \\n\\nBut with the virus alot of oil is not really being used. So storehouse tanks are really in a bizzare situation for the first time in the world where supply is much more than demand. But this price is short term and only really on paper. Reduce the prices, we will store it in our fuel tanks. I have two large buckets. Can I help? How is the price gonna stay same as storage go full? Eventually they have to throw out the oil then like US did by paying people to take petrol. If excise is a percentage wont that go to 0 and block govt income? looking for bhakts to help explain the curent prices of petrol at the pump. And prices for consumers are same as before. I guess our finance minister skipped some commerce lessons in school. joker needs to make a televized video asking all bhakts to get and store petrol in their's water tanks. i suppose this will give extra space to import more fuel during this windfall and improve deficit rather than disinvesting hurriedly in coming times. surely this gov. has fucked up economy Open the fucking country man. Not that I am gonna help with the petrol problem. I use bicycle for everything but I will atleast give her a chain a deep clean with some petrol. Ideally it should. But the govt keeps increasing the cess and taxes on petrol and diesel and maintaining the same price. I personally don't think passing the benefits is not a good idea , economically it obviously decrease govt expenditure on imports, and there should be carbon discipline cheaper availability of crude oil products is not good for environment, by not passing the benefits govt can use the excess money for capital expenditure and in investment. Now in these unprecedented times not encashing on reduced import bill will be dumb. In future when prices reach normal it will became a political tool for opposition to point to govt how petrol prices are increasing. Crude price has only marginal impact on petroleum product prices, that too with a considerable lag. \\n\\nCrude has to be transported and refined, the cost of which does not change with falling crude price. After that, the cost of refined crude makes up about 50% of the final patrol price, the rest are central excise, state VAT, dealer margin, distribution cost etc. given that tax revenues have basically cratered, government will use these lower rates to shore up on reserves Oil supply agreements are based on hedging. That is future contracts wherein it is stated that a particular commodity will be purchased on a specific price only no matter what the orignal price of commodity is in the future. This contract is done to avoid the effect of price changing due to market conditions. Mitroonn... announcing a new **2% storage cess.** Nope the regime fucked up the economy so they will make their revenue from this forget about decreasing they are planning to increase the price even more I don't think so. The sale has dropped off precipitously and the govt is seeing huge losses in revenue. There is no way the govt can afford more loss of revenue. It seems as if you are the only guy who actually does some research Last I checked at around 8:39 pm on Wed 22 April 2020, the WTI crude oil was trading at $15,plus india basket of crude(BRENT) never went to zero, only WTI did, from which India does not buy. The lowest Brent went was around 16 this week. Also, that was may/June contract, which nosedived.\\n\\nAlso, the crude oil from which current petrol, diesel stock comes, must be purchased by india anywhere between 1 month to last week.\\n\\nSo if the government doesn't Decide to increase cess and other taxes (which considering their greed, they will) the current price of crude oil will come to consumers in may only.\\n\\nI miss those days when government used to give petrol on huge subsidies (pre 2014) >Look this does mean that you can go to a petrol station and get free gas Yeah I wonder why. I read the barrel costs more than actual oil. What's with the multiple taxes & cess? Can someone ELI5. India buys Brent crude, which has only marginally reduced.\\n\\nHear it from Former Minister Milind Deora.\\n\\n> India imports Brent crude - not WTI - currently priced at $21/barrel.\\n\\n> We will import less oil due to weakened demand. Falling ₹ may also offset gains from low oil prices.\\n\\n> Lastly, when 🚗, 🚌, 🚂 & ✈️ are sitting idle, consumers can’t gain from petrol & diesel price cuts\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/milinddeora/status/1252520099614990337 The government can put that 8 rupee tax hike in its own ass. India imports most of its crude oil. This practice of increasing cess and taxes has always been a tactic used by the Indian governments to save money and also generate revenue. It seems exploitative though it is sound economics as India spends alot of money importing oil. Just an fyi for the uninformed. Petroleum still attracts excise and vat. There is no gst on petroleum. Current government has fucked up the economy and is trying to recover it through increased taxes and cesses. The price remains the same for consumers but the price difference is used to fill the government coffers. We don't buy from WTI. I meant the price drop from 50 to 20 of the Brent.  Not the WTI. > t seems exploitative though it is sound economics as India spends alot of money importing oil.\\n\\nThere is an alternate economic theory where in the benefits passed on to the consumer will have a better multiplier effect on the economy leading to increased tax collections than the direct tax collections on petrol. So no its not based on sound economics. >  always been a tactic used \\n\\nHonest question. Under UPA oil was at $140 a barrel at its peak. But petrol was till rs 70. its its not always I wonder why Such sad state of affairs. The tax and cess is collected for years now but what is being done with all the money. No one questions the government and those question are suppressed. \\n\\nPretty sure more than necessary is recouped. You are partially wrong on taxes.\\nCentre doesn't want to reduce cess because before deregulation, Centre had to pay huge subsidies for decades to maintain a price range so now they have to make up for all the lost capital. \\n\\n\\nAlso petrol, diesel are also not under GST, so state government can charge whatever tax they want. If you have a problem with that then talk to your state government. To certain extent Centre does not control what price you pay in your city. \\n\\n\\nBut you won't be successful because the states fought for oil products and alcohol to be outside of GST perview when the bill was signed because both of these are huge revenue \\n sources for states which are all broke AF. \\n\\n\\nAnd the current price fall is for May contracts for which the actual product hasn't even shipped, this price fall is just speculation. June contracts would actually gain prices compared to May. \\n\\nIndia is a huge importer of oil. We don't have huge oilfields. Oil being a volatile commodity with geopolitics now playing a large part in its price, I rather we maintain a constant higher price range than suffer oil shocks whenever the OPEC+ cartel throws a hissy fit. \\n\\nAnd go to any Indian city, the amount of cars and bikes tell me that petrol prices aren't an issue it seems. \\n\\nI know I would be downvoted for going against the circlejerk but I would rather the govt tax petrol a lot and use the funds for infrastructure development. Honestly I feel we aren't making people pay the true cost of this environmentally destructive product yet. Most cities need to start increasing prices for licensing and registration, congestion tax and anything to get as much revenue from personal automobile ownership. \\n\\nRather than complaining about not getting petrol cheaper than pepsi, people should be fighting and demanding better public and mass transit. Personal automotive ownership is and should always be a luxury. But its just a short term measure which will not go on for too long and then what will these lunatics do It could be so but there is a reality also of India being dependent on oil imports. This is a major expenditure on the part of the government also oil being a volatile commodity if its price spikes the Indian consumer does not buy petrol or diesel according to the international price. The bottomline is that no government in the past has ever tried to pass on the benefits as it is just too lucrative for government revenues. Because thats a big source of income for the state governments. Same is the case with alcohol and tobacco products. \\n\\nUnder gst the revenue will be less and and the revenue will first go to the central govt. The central govt will then remit the amount to the state government. \\n\\nDont take me on my word. Im paraphrasing what my gst professor told me in the first class. Thanks for taking the time to reply. What you have said makes a lot of sense. \\n>But its just a short term measure which will not go on for too long\\n\\nHaha. We've been saying this for years. What will we do? Protest?\\n\\nModiji says vannakam. i am not sure if you know but UPA actually subsidized Petrol and Diesel. India decided to tag the petrol price to global oil prices and removed all subsidies. The first time the prices fell has been in 2015 after Modi came to power. So both of your assumptions are wrong. So please learn the facts before you start blabbering. No you’re right \\n\\nBut I think there are other interests involved too I thought he was going on a raging rant but he started making sensei how long can you go scamming people Why do you think UPA subsidized petrol and diesel? The oil price was through the roof and if oil were to hit 100 dollars a barrel you won't be paying according to the international price cause that is not possible for a country like India. Well I will be honest that its hard to not feel rage in this sub when all topics devolve into same partisan bs comments. Most jokes are predictable and more cringe than funny.\\n\\n\\nI fully realize that discussions about any broad policy issues is pretty useless when everyone just wants the top voted meaningless one-liner.\\n\\nWorse still having discussions about reforms to economy when even the privileged people on this subreddit expect freebies. Reading this whole thread is people wishing for subsidies to be back. Showing even a little bit support to a particular policy by current government gets you labelled a bhakt or the similar cringey insults. I wish this was a subreddit to discuss indepth policy and broad trends devoid of partisan pettiness but everyone enjoys drama it seems. Long enough to keep them stupid and raise another generation of stupid ignorant slaves. Fuckin hell Exactly. \"},\n",

Unpopular Opinion: But if I were an Indian Rich, even I wouldn’t donate in India. There is no proper authentic mechanism or government procedure in this time of need to collect donations from public. Moreover, there is no official directive from government as well regarding the steps they are taking for testing. Everything is internal and the public is being treated as by-standing audience. Is it even possible to hear the clapping from Antilla? What percentage of your net worth have you donated this week? Amid all this, the CEO of Career Point just pledged to provide all his classrooms to be converted into quarantine zones if need arises. More businessmen should learn from him. Problem is not clapping and ringing bells to appreciate the work of health workers. \\n\\nBut the problem is how these videos will be used as PR exercise by Modi and Godi Media, while taking the focus away from the real problem at hand i.e Coronavirus.

This is the reason these blokes tweet in support of this 5pm thing.  This way they would appear to do something. I was jamming to some tunes on my balcony, enjoying this pre-apocalyptic afternoon, suddenly all my neighbors came out their homes and gave me a 5 min standing ovation, some were so extra with those fireworks though. Thank you everyone. Stay blessed. Also I heard some few days ago that Hindustan Uniliver(I don\\'t know if I spelled it correctly) has increased the prices of its products. Businessman don\\'t care about people if it gives them fame or bring them money. We as Indians expect everything for free and cheap, so we should not expect donations. Ambani donated rs500 crore for ram mandir ...but nothing  for corona /r/agedlikemilk Bloody fucking assholes! \\nEven more astounding is the complete failure of the govt machinery. US atleast does not have mandatory CSR on companies and a much lower tax rate compared to India u do know many bwood stars donate too right? nai par gora dick dikha chadna to hai hum indians ko I have heard this from my friend who has family diamond business.

Just a cough or simple hand shake will bring their empire of money down. These are simply not good people. Well, even us normal people on reddit can help and donate.

The problem is fundamental, our thirst for \\'free\\' healthcare and medicines has hollowed out the pharma industry. We have no R&D, no proper manufacturing. Which Indian actor is billionaire?

They have already promised job security to all their full-time and contractual employees, which is a massive feat considering the size of their workforce. I believe they will do more. I\\'m absolutely ready and other people here have express interest too. I have been looking around to find how to donate. A simple ventilator can start from 15 lacs to 30 lacs depending on it\\'s type. Look at mr moneybags here wanting to know girish a ventilator company costs. You want to give the Indian government more money?? LOLOL that\\'s why you need labor unions to act as a check on the power of employers whether they\\'re public or private sector. part and parcel of why American companies fuck over all of us who work for them is because the US gutted labor protections over the past 50 years 1)I spent around 10k of my 10 lakh savings to buy masks and sanitizers for our chc, so more than him.

Do yourself a favour and block him/her, there\\'s no getting through with those people. Well, I don\\'t have lakhs lying around either, but 10k is still 1% of my net worth. I\\'m not disagreeing with the fact that it\\'s a lot of money but please stop with the glorification, there are actual volunteers, nurses, doctors, healthcare workers, shelf stackers, warehouse workers who are doing much more to have their efforts called jackshit by bootlickers.\\n\\nBill gates can take a holiday for a month and nothing will fundamentally change in covid 19 efforts, but if a single nurse doesn\\'t pull their weight then there will be a much bigger effect on the healthcare system.

I agree our political structure is broken, we need socialism. He wouldn’t be where he is if he wasn’t a ruthless businessman and he wouldn’t be doing things he’s currently doing if he wasn’t where he is today. That’s gonna happen sometime or another, by Gates or someone else. India has started tracking people, is trying to put an end to encryption etc.. what can we do about it? Got a source for your claim?

If people are unhappy with a system, they can vote for a government who promises to implement the same. The rich guy\\'s infrastructure will not have any checks and balances that come with a democratic system.\\n\\n \\n\\nI concede the extent of corruption in the Indian politics is too much and one of the ways to improve the situation would be to remove political corporate donations from corporations and only have campaigns funded by small donations. Cool. End of discussion then, right? The numbers are low mostly because we aren\\'t testing anywhere close to what\\'s required. India: 14514, Australia: 113615, Germany: 167000, Iran: 80000 Lockdowns have come in a little too late. Free healthcare does not does not mean hollowing out the pharma industry. No R&D and manufacturing is a failure of govt\\'s lack of foresight. Millionaires can\\'t donate? Yeah, Under Capitalism, charity is primarily for tax evasion. So they are stealing from public more than they are giving back. Yes, I would like to make another point here. Pointing fingers, blame game won\\'t help us here. I would infact even go as far as to say this post by [u/vitaminberry1](https://www.reddit.com/user/vitaminberry1/) is nothing more than a validation for him to piss on the rich, the govt etc. I love your entitlement to others money and efforts.

There are movements to get union representatives on company board of directors. Labour unions are corrupt themselves. Union leaders usually get bribes by the management and brainwash the workers from not protesting.

Its just fashionable for people with no credentials to criticize those trying to make a difference with whataboutism. He makes money because his wealth is in the stock market.

There are little discretionary profits to even think of doing any type of R&D.

Everyone wants free medicines, free everything. The politicians with the help of bureaucrats go to squeeze every last rupee of profit to make it feasible.\\n\\nThe end result is in front of everyone. Enjoy it. The one thing we have done better than the west are lockdowns. I agree that our testing is lacking and the numbers don\\'t represent reality.

This is about WHO and UNICEF right? Think I’ve read that before.\\n\\nThe article says, GAVI only comes into play by providing funds when WHO and UNICEF run out of funds. If anything, the whole sterilization thing and drive for unnecessary vaccines is by the WHO and UNICEF. While these might all be true, they\\'re irrelevant for the current situation. An earlier lockdown, strict enforcement, expanding of hospital supplies, making sure enough ventilators are available does not require any deep R&D from pharma. \" Well, he\\'s giving back more than an average Joe. He has allegedly paid $10bn in taxes alone, which is significantly more than a Wall Street banker or a teacher or a plumber or a software engineer.  Also, I won\\'t call it \"stealing\".\"\\n\\nIts irrelevant what\\'s happening in absolute terms, right? He may have paid a huge sum in taxes in absolute terms - but what is it relative to the income? We have to see relative terms. Average Middle class Joes\\' assets pay like 30% of their income as tax. The Capitalist class evade this because they make their income via Capital gains which is taxed lower, the assets they own (stock) don\\'t have property tax unlike middle class Joes\\' assets, or they use charity tax loop holes, or they use tax haven based evasion (or they pay into the political system and get favors or evade regulations), and they get tax breaks, and get bailouts, and white collar crimes are barely ever persecuted, and there is insufficient regulatory apparatus to stop the insider trading that happens all the time in the finance, energy markets, or the reckless speculation that puts the stability of the markets itself at risk etc etc. That\\'s the \\'stealing\\' the Capitalist class does.\\n\\nThe Capitalist class and their enterprises utilize govt made infrastructure way more in their supply chains, than the average Joe. They should be paying at very high Progressive tax rates compared to the average Joe. But they pay less than the Average Joe percentage wise.\\n\\nThat\\'s the \\'stealing\\' the Capitalist class does.\\n\\n\" If a provision exists in the tax rules and somebody is using it to reduce their tax burden then so be it. \"\\n\\nA provision doesn\\'t exist out of the blue. Perhaps in some other imaginary universe, they exist out of the blue with no context. But in our reality, Capitalists invest in lobbying efforts and other political funding efforts which influence the language of the law. They are literally responsible for investing in creating these loopholes. American military apparatus can destroy nations that don\\'t cooperate with them economically - you think Cayman Islands can defiantly be a tax haven that defies the American Empire without their permission? No. Tax havens literally exist because of American Capitalists - and global Capitalist and political classes also partake in this of course.\\n\\n\"We use ELSS deductions, Insurance deductions, Claim HRA (by showing tax receipts paid to our parents), tax harvesting all the time. Won\\'t that equate to stealing then?\"\\n\\nYeah, the very reason such a complex tax structure exists is because the political class which is funded by the Capitalists keeps creating special tax provisions, which may end up being decent exemptions for certain section of middle class citizens (and create the illusion that the govt is being generous to them) - but their main purpose is to create massive upward shifts of wealth to the rich. This is the reason there is huge money in the political system - investors go by the math and investments into the political system can give insanely higher returns than an index of the best stocks. There were some recent tax breaks passed in the US, and most of the benefits went to the top 1% or whereabouts.\\n\\nTo put it simply - middle class Joes who pay 30% are already overpaying compared to the Capitalist class. So, HRA and those exemptions end up being peanuts in this calculation.\\n\\nAnyway, about all of this also being \\'stealing\\'. Sure, I do think that does amount to stealing. Any tax exemptions to the upper middle class (while the poor whose labor sustains the economies are suffering without basic amenities) is theft. But it is theft that is dwarved by the larger theft of the Capitalist class. But this does amount to petty theft IMO. You raise a good point.\\n\\nThis middle class petty theft exists because Capitalism is built on a very fundamental \\'theft\\' - i.e. taking the surplus generated by the labor (whether skilled or unskilled) of a worker. And not paying fair taxes on this extracted wealth.\\n\\nTLDR: Legality is not morality. Capitalism compromises Democracy by giving way too much influence to few individuals over the law. So you can\\'t look at legality as proxy for morality. We have to see morality first, then decide if the laws are good enough for justice or not. Thanks for your contribution.\\n\\n Probably that\\'s what Ambani\\'s and Adani\\'s are doing. that 10k makes no difference, his 36 billion does even if its a small percentage of his wealth.\\n\\nWe were talking about Gates and not the others.

The inability to collect taxes is a failure on the government\\'s part.

Making one requires lots of parts again thanks to our free everything no one is making profits in them to have a good manufacturing base. We import most of them at a handsome cost. A healthy industry could have stepped up. The only one is Cipla which itself does 0 R&D. It made a difference to the chc I work in you imbecile. It  keeps doctors and nurses safe, a CHC covers 80,000 people. It keeps them safe. Keep on bootlicking the rich since in your opinion doctors and nurses are doing jackshit. I\\'m saying that bill gates got more coverage for donating a 100 million, while you don\\'t know how many doctors are hospitalised or have died fighting this disease. How many doctors Cuba has sent to help out third world countries. Hell, I didn\\'t know that Cuban doctors were instrumental in fighting the Ebola crisis.\\n\\nI believe a megarich person donating a miniscule amount of money is much less important than doctors, healthcare workers, nurses putting their lives on the line. They are staking their lives, bill gates can earn back 200 million in two days. But the asha worker responsible for 5000 people, who earns only 3000 rupees per month knows that she doesn\\'t have money for an ICU bed if she contracts the disease, yet she puts her life on the line.\\n\\n If objectivity were kept in mind then a person contributing 0.001% to the effort won\\'t have news paper articles written on him while the 99.999% go unacknowledged. > Public Universities and private universities in the US have research funded by corporate America. \\n\\nYou\\'ll do well to do a little more research before calling out others for their ignorance. NIH is by far the largest funder of academic biomedical research in the US. It also funds a lot of research at startups and established companies. 1) the money spent on polio eradication till now is 4.5 billion, money given by a man who is richer than 130 countries of the world is 86 million, that is 0.0018 th of the total expenditure. Yet you credit him with polio eradication when doctors in periphery and healthcare workers are doing more.but we are jack shit as stated by you.\\n\\n2) the total cost of immunization over a period of 10 years is 35.5 billion as estimated by GAVI, the second richest man has contributed a whopping 0.02 th of the expenditure. But healthcare workers and doctors who spend a 10th of their salary are jackshit as said by you.\\n\\n3) considering the JE vaccine was developed by ICMR and NIV, that 27 million probably went to pay the salary of PATH. Who probably earn more than the researchers in ICMR combined\\n\\n4) TB my favorite, the cost of implementing NSP is 2.5 billion only in India, there are 29 more HBCs. So the total cost is more or less around 10 billion. So that covers around 0.028th of the expenditure. A TB patient spends 20% of his income recovering. Woe is me if I expect a man richer than 130 countries to do a little bit more\\n\\n5) genuinely helped leishmaniasis, so won\\'t refute\\n\\n6) endorsements do nothing, India also endorsed SDGs but did fuck all to target it.\\n\\n7) governments ( funded by our taxes) spend around 1 trillion per year for vaccine r and d.\\nA man richer than any of us could ever dream to be, contributes  0.00046th of the share, while us plebs contribute more than 99.9% of this money.\\n\\nYou simply linked diseases without any actual cost benefit analysis, and seem to assume that the work doctors and health workers do is jackshit. Maybe pickup a who report on any disease and get a sense of where 99.9% of all the funding comes from, it isn\\'t from the people richer than 99.99999% of everyone on Earth.\\n\\nHere\\'s bill gates on inequality\\n\\nhttps://www.financialexpress.com/industry/bill-gates-my-113-billion-net-worth-shows-wealth-inequality-in-the-world/1813682/\\n\\nHe may be better than most billionaires but he ain\\'t a saint. You couldn\\'t be more wrong with your 1st point. An experimental drug that is rumoured to be effective against Sars-cov-2 is REMEDESIVIR it was the result of a research by University of Alabama with Gilead funded by us Taxpayers. Drug was later patened by Gilead. They are known for their disgusting high pricing. They charge 1000usd per pill for hepatitis c again a pill that was funded by us tax payers.\\n\\n National Institutes of Health has put some $900\\xa0billion into research that drug companies then used to patent brand-name medications.\\n\\n Every single drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 2010 and 2016 involved science funded with tax dollars through the NIH, according to the advocacy group\\n\\xa0\" Patients for Affordable Drugs \". Taxpayers spent more than $100 billion on that research. Those are cases I saw and managed just last week, I\\'m well within my rights to criticise people accumulating wealth. Funnily enough you guys hating rich people sounds exactly like jealousy and come out as petty and immature. How ironic, I think the same about you. But I wonder, what are we fighting about and why? Is it wrong to agree with different views of life? Should there be only one way of life and should having another be considered as ignorance? What do we gain in this petty fight over the internet about who’s right? Did I ask you for your opinion? Why did you give it to me? Was it charity? Why is the idea of change so hard to digest? Why does our whole existence go into doubt when someone merely proves our beliefs wrong? Why do we argue and fight to save our beliefs?\\n\\n\\nNow let me watch some Netflix ya. Chill mar thu bhi. That line is the law of nature! Bye. 18 goddamn pages research paper-ish essay for simple proof of bill gates involvement in forced sterilization. Wah.\\n\\nGive some actual conclusive evidence that is comprehensible, not this gish gallop. Lol! What the fuck you taking about?! They are still operating in india: https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Where-We-Work/India-Office/About-the-India-Office A few countries have locked down way before they reached hundreds of cases. Inspite of the checks before the lockdown, people have been gathering in groups (Shaheen bag, Shivraj singh) and high risk people have managed to travel and infect others (Kanika, Hyderabad student). About your healthcare rant I don’t see any data just some opinion that you have repeated 3 times in a row now. Lmao dude. Where do you think those Doctor\\'s researching or doing R&D gets the fund to do so ? Have you seen how much the Gates Foundation donated for the R&D and distribution of vaccines in Africa.    \\n\\nAnd do you really think a poor person donating 1000 rupees should get news coverage because that is more when compared to his total net worth or the once Richest person in the world and the biggest philanthropist who is donating billions should get the coverage ? Gee so hard to decide, right ? It\\'s their money either way, they didn\\'t actually have to donate anything but they still are doing so.\\n\\nHow can you be so gullible ? Even my own mother is a Govt. Doctor in a small tahsil, but I am not so naive.    \\n\\nMaybe in an utopia what you say might be right, but in today\\'s capitalistic world, that\\'s how things are. You can either accept it or keep whining, either way, what philanthropist Millionaires/billionaires are doing cannot be discredited. They literally give employment for millions of people. This👍 .... he really needs to do some research man idk what made him come to that conclusion. NIH has put in 900 Billion USD since 1930s in Biomedical research and this taxpayer funded research so far has only by used by big pharma to Patent this research and then charge the taxpayers 450,000 usd for cancer treatment with Drugs like Kymriah & Gilead which is the p4p the greatest greedy pharma fucks of all time they charge 1k USD /pill used in Hep c treatment. Btw their drug REMEDESIVIR is rumoured to be effective against Sars-cov-2 and they already thinking about making bank with this crisis. I am happy to change my mind and be corrected, all the sources i have access to including some subscription resources say that the private sector spends more on researching drugs than the NIH. I agree with you that majorly public sector funded research should be more open.\\n\\nFrom NIH\\'s own report:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83123/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83123/) \\n\\nIn 2004, federal agencies funded roughly one-third of all U.S. biomedical R and D ([Moses et al. 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83123/#)). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) accounted for three-quarters of this amount. Private sector drug, biotechnology, and medical device companies provide the majority of U.S. biomedical R and D funding (about 58 percent). Everybody is accumulating wealth including your daily wage labourer. Some are just better at it than others. Its the job of the govt to step in and give the ones on the wrong end of it a safety net. Funnily enough you guys still can’t tell that “not glorifying” is not the same as “hating”, even though it has been explicitly spelled out for you. [deleted] There is no hard evidence I\\'ll admit it. Just conjecture. But Gates rhetoric is similar to the one in the paper. It would provide you with more context as to how population control policies are inherently racist in nature. 99.9% of funding for all public sector R and D comes from the taxes paid by citizens. And billionaires don\\'t employ millions, railways and other public sectors do. >they already thinking about making bank with this crisis.\\n\\nCapitalism FTW! Let no human tragedy go unmilked! And government will do that only when billionaires pay their fair share of taxes. Not like Amazon which paid zero federal taxes. No company works on its own, yet they privatise their profits. Well, sorry but calling people who support rich people as bootlicker does sound more like hatred. Greed is a nature of a human being. What you say greed, was his dream and I can only respect that he achieved it. I’m sorry, I cannot agree with you but I do respect what you meant. No hard evidence, just went on tangentially to one line from a interview and made 2+2=5 with some dubious logic. Bro come-on. And pretty ironic that *you* are calling something racist. Well Amazon or Flipkart or Snapdeal or Zomato or Swiggy or Infosys or Apple or Samsung or L&T or Zara or one of thousands other companies run by Billionaires where millions of people work would disagree. A huge section of people work in these industries. The govt has plenty of money. Let them first start spending what money they have properly then we can talk about giving them more. If calling people who obtained obscene amounts of wealth through exploitation and shady business tactics “gifts to humanity” just because they do some good things now is not bootlicking, then I don’t know what is. How is it ironic? '},\n",

Paisabazaar is asking documents as per bank\\'s requirements. Sharing the bank website link here. [https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/borrow/popular-loans/two-wheeler-loan/documentation](https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/borrow/popular-loans/two-wheeler-loan/documentation) I think this is a requirement by the bank (HDFC) in this case. That\\'s what their website says - \\xa0 \\xa0https://www.hdfcbank.com/personal/borrow/popular-loans/two-wheeler-loan/documentation\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\nPaisabazaar is just facilitating the information. I don\\'t think they ask for your CC info. The bank which is offering you the loan may. Picture of credit card, front and back 😂😂what about CVV?? lol @ front and back \\\\0/ and you asking if this is shady ?? Personally I wouldn\\'t take a loan, but having a credit card could be useful in emergencies.\\n\\nAs far as this process of Paisabazaar goes they may be trying to safeguard their own security by having an alternate way of collecting payment through CC.\\n\\nFor example, if you crash your bike and die or it gets stolen or you default on repaying the loan they could recover their funds from your Credit Card and then you would owe the Credit Card company instead of the Paisabazaar.\\n\\nI might be wrong, but lending companies would not be able to exist without some back up plan to recover their funds. You should upload pics of your front and back and see what they respond. 😃 Thanks. I was just researching interest rates and process without signing in! \\n\\nIs bankbazaar bad too? \\n\\nI did create an account ages ago and never deleted.

Better late than never. Hope no one got scammed. in many websites they only ask for card no/ expiry and CVV number. Amazing. CVV is on the back of the card. It wasn’t a direct question. It was more like-\\n\\n“this is shady, isn’t it?” Many loans are associated with insurance scheme equivalent to the amount. Ehh. No \\n\\nThanks for the creepiness >Is bankbazaar bad too? \\n\\nThey both share same database. \\n\\nI installed their app in 2016, i still receive load offers , even after multiple folloups , they still keep sending me emails. Non public private information.  \\n\\nLike mothers middle name. Etc etc. \\n\\nThe banks verify  ones identity based on this non public information.  \\n\\nBy collecting NPI information,  both bank bazar and policy bazar are putting their customers at risk. \\n\\nThese are only middle men. They have no justification to collect NPI. Hi, no, I am into Software Engineering though. Bit surprising to hear that you didn\\'t get the response. Maybe you can search on the Internet on how to report such violations? Also, doing good deeds shouldn\\'t make you feel silly. You\\'re making the world a better place! Thanks! name and shame? Report them they will. nothing we can do though. Yes they hire untrained employees and the eligibility criteria for getting in company is a joke.... Moreover the employees don\\'t give shit about the customers they are just running behind the incentives that they get over their 15k base salary.  They don\\'t care where u come from or who you are until they earn the extra buck ... After that you are nothing.... Trust me i speak as an ex employee It is sometimes practice to provide a cancelled cheque. But a signed blank cheque is just bollocks. Call banks and tell them about it.

I also saw a series of articles on how they are working with the Govt for waivers on auto loans for their driver community \\n- Let’s not take the pitch fork each time , and be grateful atleast \\n4.I will not choose to comment on the salary piece, I personally think it’s a good gesture note that his net worth is also including Ola shares , which are valuable only if the company does well , which he is working very hard towards\\n\\n( made some punctuation changes ) This post sounds like you just want to get on the anti-capitalism bandwagon. And I say all this without bias. I\\'m no fan of Ola. I wouldn\\'t take their rides even if they offered me free service.\\n\\n1. Ola had 15 lakh drivers as of 2019. Even if it were to give everyone just Rs 2,000 as a one-time gesture, that\\'s 300 crores. I guess most would agree you need, at the very least, Rs 5000 to get thru this period. That\\'s 750 crores.\\n\\n2. So whether they donate 20 or 50 cr, it doesn\\'t matter. If you were Ola management, you\\'d want to start crowdfunding as soon as possible because you\\'re going to run short. I\\'d appreciate that sort of foresight to assist drivers, instead of bashing such moves.\\n\\n3. Don\\'t forget that they are ultimately a loss-making entity (losing more than 2000 crores every year). They\\'re not raising VC money to channel it all to charity. And, like other comments have mentioned, they don\\'t even have adequate cash in the first place. Valuation != cash in hand. Do you want them to fuck over all their corporate employees to pay drivers? Why?\\n\\n4. Ola\\'s top management has already taken salary cuts, with the CEO letting go of his entire annual salary. Yeah you could argue it\\'s no biggie as he\\'s still filthy rich. But so what? What more do you want them to do? And why, in the first place? \\n\\nSo why is this surprising? Are you new to capitalism? \\n\\nAlso\\n> When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country \\n\\nu wot m8? Chutiye.. Valuation is not cash on hand. daily reminder that valuation doesn\\'t mean cash in hand. And yes, ceo should just donate his annual salary because unke paas \"bohot\" paise h that he didn\\'t earn with his skill. Do you even finance mate? Anyone who posts stuff like this should be made to take a course in basic corporate finance. Lol this is very Whatsapp uncle finance logic. Valuations are used to get more funding, and then they burn through that, only to come up with a higher valuation next time for higher funding. It\\'s a vicious cycle. Ola and such companies can never be profitable with the same approach, they\\'re just going down a path of no return and making as much as they can in the process. The tenet of business is the same today as it was a 100 years ago: You go on spending more than you earn, the bubble will burst and you\\'re going belly up. No exceptions. OP, you should learn some basic economics Dai, first understand the difference between Valuation, Cashflow, Revenue and Runway. Then write chutiya posts like these. Most Indian startups are money sucking cesspools. They claim to innovate, but do not.\\n\\nUber and all the sharing economy companies are never going to be profitable. See their stock calls and annual reports if you think I\\'m lying. Learn basic economy OP, they probably aren\\'t even making any money or it\\'s very razor thin, a month of lock down and following uncertainty is already huge dent in there revenue Ola Cares Ola is paying its employees.  The drivers aren\\'t employees. They don\\'t pay their drivers. They give the drivers approx 80% of the ride fare. Denmark govt has agreed to pay 75% of employees salaries for all companies for next 3 months. Which basically means people\\'s tax $ are used as a wage subsidy. This happens because companies don\\'t have much liquidity & financial institutions don\\'t have much liquidity to give loans. So the govt acts as lender of last resort.\\n\\nIts not much different than companies asking for donations from people here. This is because crazed mentality of Indians running after discounts and offers. There is no brand loyalty and crazy competition from outside That\\'s not how company valuations work. The billions in valuation refer to their stock. You can\\'t pay employees in stock. You need liquid money. It is. Fuck \\'em. Btw you\\'re right about the PR stunt angle. It makes the little people who donate feel like they\\'re personally invested in the company (we\\'re all in this together one for all all for one and all that good stuff) when the millionaire company execs themselves clearly aren\\'t.\\n\\nAlso loling at all the people shilling for these Ahole corporates in this thread.. far too many of them. I did enquire about their model. The drivers have to give a certain amount of money every month to their \\'handler\\' while they get to keep the surplus (if they make any that is). Sometimes they pay it out of their own pocket. It\\'s insane and all around the world \\n\\nThe CEO\\'s cant stand giving away few dollars from their obscene amount of millions. And Ola drivers are not really Ola employees. This I\\'m aware that they won\\'t actually be having 10 Billion usd in their pockets. I still think 50 cr is not too significant amount for a company as large as Ola. Companies (with Olas scope) move money around like this all the time when it directly contributes to expansion and profit. How much do you think would putting Ola Prime sets in all their cabs would have cost? How many people do you even think use Ola Prime TV and music?\\nBut when it comes to actually doing something charitable, they need US to carry most of the weight. Because in this scenario, the livelihoods of their core employees isn\\'t as important as making a profit. It doesn\\'t make any sense whatsoever that crowdfunding is more efficient that just paying the whole amount themselves. \\n\\nIt has been appreciated because that was the whole point. As an added bonus to having employee salaries crowdfunded, they get amazing PR as well. The whole thing is a win for Ola\\n\\nEdit: If companies like Ola are not yet profitable and don\\'t look to be in the near future, then what exactly is the point of keeping money bleeding companies alive? Basically their upper management gets rich, they pay back the investors and then say \\'pls pay my employees\\' to the public? Is that not what is literally happening? In all fairness it\\'s a great time to criticize capitalism. With what we are seeing now, a re-evaluation of the concept of wages needs to happen. For starters, wages must account for the well being of people. This includes internalising things like decent healthcare, education, and food security at the very least. Maybe employees should have greater control over their companies, so that they have a greater say in wage determination.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nThis is also under the larger backdrop of how fragile our economy is, and how certain sections of society are extremely vulnerable - be it to the virus or in the longer term to things like climate change. The top 10% of the population controls 77% of the wealth in India. In 2017 the top 1% accumulated 73% of the wealth that was generated that year. And you think that the general population should be helping these people even more? How can you think that\\'s okay in a country of 270 million poor? \\n\\nWhat do I want them to do? Give more.  Why should they do that? Why should they give what plenty they have for the benefit of those who don\\'t? Compassion I guess.\\n\\nBut yeah you can just stand there and smirk \\'Capitalism works.\\' Capitalism works for them, not for us.\\n\\nEdit: and while they\\'re free to make a loss of 2000 cr per year while their upper management continue to get rich, we should be the ones to carry the burden? Because what, once they finally turn a profit, they\\'ll give it all back? Do you think they will EVER turn a profit in the first place? Man of culture I see. Wouldn’t have said things differently myself. Came here to say this Why are you people so upset? OP made a mistake. But genuinely curious why that\\'s making so many people use harsh language against op? Unclear if your second line is sarcastic or not... Do you? could you please explain how OLA is valued at that outrageous figure when it has no fixed assets from what I can tell, no patents, does not produce anything of value..  so what does that valuation mean and what does the huge amounts they raise from investors go into? agreed! but i am just curious what happens when the bubble gets burst? another freecharge which got acquired by snapdeal at 600 mil and sold to axis bank for less than 50 cr? Or the company completely goes bank corrupt Why are you people so upset? OP made a mistake. But genuinely curious why that\\'s making so many people use harsh language against op? TIL. Thought Ola was a fucking charity that committed the ultimate sin by not listening to OP. But they should be. That\\'s another debate though Why will US carry the weight of Indian drivers? I\\'m just passing by and making a poor joke #oksorry Don\\'t criticise the markets or they will get spooked. I agree. All of this will just be hard to enforce when we have an oversupply of labour in countries like ours How is once in a lifetime pandemic that affects the global economy a great time to criticize capitalism? > And you think that the general population should be helping these people even more?\\n\\nDid I say you need to be helping anyone? Is Ola holding a gun to your head to donate? You\\'re the one here who\\'s saying the general population _shouldnt_ help but some notionally richer person should. \\n\\n> What do I want them to do? Give more\\n\\nIf I were an Ola corporate employee, I\\'d ask - _who the fuck are you to make me take a salary cut to marginally pay drivers? Is my life not important? Do I not have loans to pay? Not everyone at Ola is upper management. Stop forcing my employer to be a charity operating exactly the way you want._\\n\\n\\n> and while they\\'re free to make a loss of 2000 cr per year while their upper management continue to get rich,\\n\\nPlease, genius entrepreneur, tell me how I should attract top talent to my startup while it makes losses. Oh, I shouldn\\'t pay them? They\\'ll work for free is it? \\n\\n> Because what, once they finally turn a profit, they\\'ll give it all back? \\n\\nWhy the fuck should they give it back? Have you offered employment to 15 lakh people? Have you offered employment to even 1% of that number? You want businesses like Ola to not run so that 15 lakh people can be jobless? Or you\\'ve got a master socialist plan none of us here are aware of? Stop assuming that large businesses don\\'t add any value to society/people.\\n\\n>  Do you think they will EVER turn a profit in the first place?\\n\\nSo we should outlaw any businesses if they cannot turn a profit? We should stop people from trying? People that don\\'t know how finances work shouldn\\'t criticize other companies without doing research. > But genuinely curious why that\\'s making so many people use harsh language against op?\\n\\nTo be curious is one thing. But OP here is on a rant thinking he\\'s figured it all out, with exaggerations like \"When you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country\". We just responded in equal measure to the stupidity I guess. It is. [removed] Don’t think that’s how it works. \\n\\nMerchants on amazon don’t become amazon employees. It’s just a place for them to earn money by delivering value. Uber/Ola are no different. It’s just a place where drivers can offer what they do. And that\\'s how companies avoid paying them better salaries. Exactly my thoughts, bhencho US ke waise hi lawde lage huay hain, oopar se Ola ke paap bhi wohi bhare lmao So people should just die because it\\'s once in a lifetime/100 years? That\\'s stupid. This is simplistic, but when we had world war 1, we didn\\'t fix things, and look where that got us.\\n\\nThis is also exactly why I mentioned climate change as well. The entire issue with climate change is that it makes extreme events like hurricanes, floods etc happen much more frequently than under baseline (no warming) conditions. This means that a once in 100 years storm could possibly happen once in 20 years, because of the warming. It\\'s foolish for the economy to not prepare for this, just like it was foolish to not prepare for a pandemic despite knowing very well that something like this could happen. > Have you offered employment to 15 lakh people? ✘\\n\\n> Have you offered employment to even 1% of that number? ✘\\n\\n> You want businesses like Ola to not run so that 15 lakh people can be jobless? ✘\\n\\n> Or you\\'ve got a master socialist plan none of us here are aware of? ✘\\n\\nBut have you heard about our lord our savior socialism >Don’t think that’s how it works. \\n\\nThat is strictly your opinion. It is a hotly contested debate in labour relations worldwide. Umm, I don\\'t think you understand the meaning of \"debate\". We all know that\\'s now how it works, einstein... but should it be that way? That analogy doesn\\'t work. Sellers/buyers on Amazon are more akin to riders on Ola/Uber. The drivers are more comparable to the delivery guys for Amazon. Both drivers and delivery guys are classified as non-employees because they\\'re engaged as \"agents\" but the nature of their engagement means that they are in fact employees. It\\'s actually a scummy way for these companies to avoid having to take on the obligations that come with having these people as regular employees. Okay, then if you\\'re a marketplace/you\\'re a cab aggregating service, charge them to be on your platform through a subscription service or something. If you\\'re taking a cut of the value created by their labor (i.e. the cab ride itself), then they\\'re your employee. Merchants get to set their own rate. Freelancers can set their own rates. Any other contract work allows contractor the freedom to charge whatever. Uber driver is the worst of all worlds. They don\\'t get employee benefits, and they don\\'t get freedom to choose their own rates. How the fuck is that okay? Merchants on Amazon sell their goods\\n\\nDrivers on Ola sell their labour.\\n\\nCompletely different things Same goes for all the freelance job websites.\\n\\nYou don\\'t automatically become their employee. So pls understand that your take on how it should be is also your opinion. \\n\\nYou think Ola it Uber can take all the drivers into their payroll and give salary to each of them? It’s the most deluded suggestion I’ve heard.\\n\\nIn your own words, it’s a ‘hotly contested debate’, not a finalised humanitarian rule. Not just that, uber drivers can\\'t set their own rates. In what other contract work are you not able to give your own pricing? Initially uber was an aggregating service so it made sense then. Drivers could be signed into two apps simultaneously. Now they can\\'t and cab companies have created a more exclusive employer-employee relationship because the ball is on the company\\'s court. its similar to how music companies have become bigger than the artists by taking a cut from each of them Sellers AND buyers are riders? and drivers are delivery guys? Wtf, are you high? You create your own marketplace and charge cab drivers how you suggest. \\nDon’t just sit on a chair and suggest how Ola or Uber should earn money. They have chosen this way. They don’t give a shit what you think it should be. \\n\\nDon’t talk bullshit rules that you make up as you go. Who said marketplace should be a fixed flat subscription? Who said that if they take a cut of their business they’re employees? Are you suggesting they’re doing something illegal? Bring up facts in a discussion, not your opinion. You know the line, opinions are like assholes... Ask any hardworking Uber driver if he’s making more money or less money since he got on it. \\n\\nThey are not going to have business during this time whether they’re are on an online service or not. That does not mean Uber or Ola owe them anything. \\n\\nUber and Ola are simply enablers that help match demand and supply at controlled rates.  We hear the driver’s side of things so much that we tend to assume that they’re in some prison. They are free to walk away from it and go old school again. But the business is on these platforms. They can get on it if they want to or miss out. \\n\\nMerchants can set their own rates, but the point is the value should be there. If another merchant sells at lower cost, this guy has no option to match that cost if he wants business or add value in his offering. \\n\\nWhen merchants can set their own rates online, it’s not complete freedom as you imagine it to be. Uber’s pricing works with base rate calculated based on how much the demand creator is ready to spend and the amount of demand. It’s more dynamic pricing compared to how a merchant prices his goods online. \\n\\nA cab driver doesn’t understand this and complains to you. You don’t blindly side with him because you’re supposed to be more educated than him. They’ll want to earn a billion rupees per kilometre and still manage to complain about something if they do in fact earn that. \\n\\nStop bringing up childish arguments. Yes. The core concept is same. They both offer value in an aggregator environment and sell it for money. Product or service is specifics that don’t matter. That is what the debate is about, no? At what point do you become an employee? \\n\\nIf you  are a contractor providing exclusive services over a long period of time to a single entity, what really defines an employee versus a contractor except that companies are exploiting loophole. \\n\\nThis is a very serious debate. For example, WWE wrestlers are contractors allowing Vince McMahon to free his hands from the arising medical complications his \\'Superstars\\' have to suffer. Yes, in my own words it is a hotly contested debate. Why are you repeating that?\\n\\nI\\'m literally saying that you\\'re entitled to your opinion, but just clarifying that you have no basis to be telling people \"that\\'s not how it works\".\\n\\nNo, the discussion is not about \"salary\", they are on a variable/commission based system it\\'s whether they are eligible for benefits that and to be considered as \"employees\" because of their relationship with the aggregators.\\n\\nThere is a lot that happens in terms of finance, pay-out schemes, etcetera than amazon\\'s relationship with vendors.\\n\\nI don\\'t need to go into detail to educate you on this, there a is metric tonne of literature lobbying both sides of the argument, [and court rulings](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/20/uber-european-court-of-justice-ruling-barcelona-taxi-drivers-ecj-eu) on this. How is it that they can\\'t? Don\\'t many drivers run Ola and Uber simultaneously? [removed] ... wow. I didn\\'t say that\\'s a rule or it\\'s illegal. I suggested a somewhat obvious idea - that if you\\'re profiting of someone\\'s labor, they are your employee. You can\\'t have it both ways - say they\\'re not your employee but also profit off their labor. If you actually have an argument to make, please make it. The vitriol is wholly unnecessary. \\n\\nP.S. - This might sound crazy to you, but not everyone is motivated by a profit motive to do things in their life. So, no thanks. I\\'ll pass on your suggestion to start my own marketplace or whatever. >A cab driver doesn’t understand this and complains to you. You don’t blindly side with him because you’re supposed to be more educated than him.\\n\\nI ride uber like 10 times a year and usually have my earphones in. I\\'m not interested in talking with drivers and they leave me alone too. My views come from more macroeconomic perspective. I guess you should read up on antitrust laws and why monopolies are bad for everyone involved except the company. While you\\'re at it you should also read on how Amazon is fucking over the merchants by introducing competitive products (under own brands like Amazon basics) and by its sheer economy of scale it can manage to sell things at a much cheaper price driving smaller merchants/companies out of business.\\n\\nYou should also read up on how and why goa didn\\'t let uber and Ola come into the market and instead follows a much different model with GoaMiles. Consider them as daily wage workers.\\n\\nNow would you classify daily wage workers as an organisation\\'s employees? Sure while they\\'re under the clock.\\n\\nAs soon as the daily agreement expires though, they\\'re no longer an employee.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t a contract bound between both the parties. The worker may simply just quit and thus he won\\'t get payed. There won\\'t be any repercussions either other than the fact that they would be barred from getting employed from the same org.\\n\\nUsually when you\\'re an employee, you sign a contract stating that the companyor the org owns you for the duration of the contract. So if the drivers sign a contract for one month, they\\'re an employee. If they don\\'t sign a contract saying so, they aren\\'t an employee and thus they can\\'t be legally charged by breaking their contract.\\n\\nThey get paid for the exact amount of service which they provide.\\n\\nSame as how taxi drivers are independent contractors and aren\\'t employees of the state. They have to buy their way into become one by buying the medallion or something. I mean if you really want to just pound your fists at something, pound it on the medallion system. Yeah. I repeated it and added a sentence following it which you conveniently chose to ignore. My point was not to say the same thing you said. You wouldn’t mention it this way if you had read it. \\n\\nSo... read it. Yeah yeah they still do. This guy is blabbing [removed] I don\\'t think the guy you are talking to applies any logic. He\\'s all like \"who says\", \"Who make the rules\\', \"make your own cab company\", while we\\'re talking about whether monopolies should be regulated and forced to take care of their workforce. Tourist areas will obviously want a better model. What are you even on about Goamiles? It’s for a different market type than traditional cities. \\n\\nYou have cab driver mentality. You just try to sound all posh. \\n\\nMerchants are not driven out, its a gradual consolidation that happens everywhere. Again, you want to only think like a bitchy merchant. Merchants will find themselves in the supply chain in a different type of role. There will be an increase in scale to make up for margin reduction. The immediate loss is temporary. \\n\\nSometimes you don’t need that many middlemen earning cuts in the supply chain. It’s happening to all industries, even in FMCG. And do zero hour contract workers/daily wage workers etc have any social safety nets? The debate revolves around this. I responded to it, did *you* read the rest of my comment? I also believe my take is just my opinion. So I have no idea what you\\'re saying to me with this message. Okay buddy. I don\\'t want to argue with imbeciles. You have a lala mentality, I\\'m happy that I have a cab driver mentality, atleast I think of the less fortunate. My first comment which started this whole argument said \"that\\'s another debate though\" which implied I\\'m in no mood for that debate. So you can keep your lala opinion, and let me have my cabbie opinion to myself.\\n\\nPS: I\\'m not posh at all and I would hate to sound like one. You can keep your poshness to yourself. I understand what the debate revolves around.\\n\\nThey should, but states and governments have abused this loophole since decades.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying it\\'s right, I\\'m just stating the facts and why it\\'s going to remain this way for a long long time.\\n\\nNow, it\\'s 3 things people need to combat :\\n\\n1) Abolish the practices for the current metered/daily wage workers.\\n\\n2) Get all of the states and their respective governments to acknowledge that they were wrong.\\n\\n3) Finally, convince the judges in the highest orders of the courts to rule a favor for these workers.\\n\\nThe first step would be to classify contractors and sub-contractors as employees of something and then and only then will they be eligible for all the safety nets which you\\'re talking about.\\n\\nInstead of arguing/debating with me for moot technicalities which don\\'t matter, you should actually write a letter to the respective politician serving you and none of the politicians are keen on doing so unless you tear them a big fat cheque that is if you really want to do something about it. I’m repeating since you’re retarded or something, but a hotly contested debate is not a rule of thumb to be adhered to. \\n\\nLearn to read properly. Back to school with you... '},\n",

Be it the 1918 Spanish Flu or the recent Cuban epidemic, the doctors who treated their patients with homeopathy lost a fraction of patients as compared to those who were treated with allopathic medicine, he said.\\n\\nDumbass. He needs to calm the fuck down. His herd immunity solution has been tried to disastrous effects in the UK and sweden. We cannot afford the rammifications that we would have to face on the way to achieving herd immunity. He should make his bikes, and let the epidemiologists decide how to manage the virus.\\n\\nAgree on the bit about the entire operation being suspended for 3 months if any one person is found positive, to be stupid.

Also read as: \"I AM NOT ABLE TO MAKE MONEY!!!!!!!!! WORKERS ARE DISPOSABLE, MY MONEY ISN\\'T!!!\" \\\\[Genuine question, not rhetorical\\\\] As I understand, not many customers are able to buy both due to lockdown and due to stress on personal finances. Dealers cannot sell as many. Is there any compelling reason for a vehicle manufacturing factory to manufacture vehicles during this time? I bet these guys are at the forefront of forcing PM\\'s hand in reopening asap no matter the devastation. Kya chutiyapa logic hai iska Now he is just sprouting bullshit and losing relevance. This guy is a fucking joke. Him and his ideas on herd immunity and homeopathy.\\n\\nHe should be asked to stand in the middle of his factory crowd all day for the full duration. As much as I personally hate bjp because of their communal ideology, modi did a right thing by forcing lockdown. Yes if they had started to thought about that in January or fab given that first case was diagnosed in india in January end. And prepared about that instead of buying MLAs in MP, they\\'d have time to systematically apply lockdown. Any bhakt who\\'d going to argue that it would have spread corona in other states, I\\'ll let you know that you can\\'t have perfection in this case. A lot of people have gone to their states by foot. It\\'s not just about delhi to Up and bihar. Just yesterday Up government has allowed 7000 kids to come home from kota. In Uk about 1800 people were allowed to come home from Gujraat. Rich people from other countries were allowed to come home by plane. Only the most poor have been exempt. finally someone told the emperor that he has no clothes. kudos. Trump approves it. Visa sanctioned 😊 the jury is still out on sweden. However, what exactly has 30 days of lockdown achieved?\\n\\n- people are starving. \\n- cases are rising  \\n- no new hospitals built  \\n- testing hasnt ramped up  \\n- PPE problems still continue\\n- Doctors and nurses are falling sick\\n- Policemen, journalists etc all testing positive\\n- Police brutality and mob lynching deaths.\\n- No system for managing food & essentials to poor.\\n\\nI am not saying lockdown is bad.. but what progress did we make using this time? business men would appreciate clarity and rationality, not dumb laws and punitive taxation. exports? \\nalso sales is driven by marketing and finance. Bajaj has a great financial arm. Interest rates are down. Harvest is done. i think its ok after a month of lockdown to have a discussion. The devastation is real. true  \"the rules under which a dealership or a factory can be sealed for up to three months if an employee is infected with Covid-19.\" its a different viewpoint, but he has a point. Our systems are inefficient. The Government is by design not agile, that sucks, we chose them. Progress we made as compared to a *non lockdown situation*:\\n\\nLESSER people are starving. \\n\\nLESSER cases are rising\\n\\nno new hospitals built - ORISSA \\n\\ntesting hasnt ramped up - WHATEVER INCREASED IS DUE TO EXISTENCE OF LOCKDOWN\\n\\nPPE problems still continue - WHATEVER INCREASED IS DUE TO EXISTENCE OF LOCKDOWN\\n\\nLESSER Doctors and nurses are falling sick\\n\\nLESSER Policemen, journalists etc all testing positive\\n\\nLESSER Police brutality and mob lynching deaths.\\n\\nNo system for managing food & essentials to poor - THIS IS JUST GETTING HIGHLIGHTED, WAS ALWAYS PRESENT\\n\\nDecades of ignoring healthcare system and prevalent corruption has brought this to us. Even our citizens are not model citizen. We will pay the price.\\n\\nhttps://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3080764/coronavirus-lockdowns-are-not-reason-hong-kong-and A little time after the lockdown, the rate of doubling of infections was 3-4 days. Now it\\'s over 10 days. And this is inspite of a much higher rate of testing. Most countries have testing as a constraint - there are only so many tests available, not much we can do about that. \\n\\nLook at the numbers for the rest of the infected countries, as a % of the population, or per million population. We\\'re dramatically better off. \\n\\nIf you say that the lockdown did no good, you\\'re either extremely pessimist and a constant naysayer, or have no idea what is going on in the rest of the world. Also, Sweden has had 175 deaths per million population. We\\'re at 0.5. The jury has announced it\\'s verdict. It\\'s a lockdown. For a reason. It\\'s clear to everyone except this champion. If he is that unconcerned he should send his kids into the factory as well and ask them to be exposed to the same conditions as workers.\\n\\nThe bugger is just acting entitled. > not many customers are able to buy both due to lockdown and due to stress on personal finances\\n\\nThis is across the world. So, exports are affected. so its a mitigation as per you. fair point. so we slowed down the spread. That is a given in a curfew. What else? sweden isnt starving username checks out Yes it\\'s a lockdown. With no clear direction in which it\\'s heading at.\\n\\nRandom directives are being changed every day now which is completely useless and pointless at the same time.\\n\\nThe central government has just created a bunch of \"guidelines\" which are extremely vague to say the least and they\\'ve basically dumped the problem to the respective state governments and are effectively keeping their hands clean of this mess.\\n\\nNow obviously each state has it\\'s own set of rules and experiments in order to curb the infection. Some states resort to under test their people while some states completely lock down it\\'s borders which inturn also affect other states.\\n\\nJust take a look at the whole Karnataka vs Kerala border issue.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s one of two things. Either the central government doesn\\'t want to get their hands dirty or they\\'re simply not in control of their own government.\\n\\nIn Pune, the shop timings were reduced to merely 2 hours yesterday. Today when I went out to stock up on some essentials, the shopkeeper told me that they\\'re not allowed to open their store at all as per the instructions given by the Police. Atleast 300-400 people were there on a single fucking street just to stock things up.\\n\\nNow because of the 2 hour rule, and because the criteria for \"essential goods\" mean different things to different people, the number of cases are going to spike insanely high for the next 5 days in Maharashtra.\\n\\nFor some people, getting new clothes for their new borns becomes an essential commodity. For a person working in IT, replacing damaged peripherals or computer parts in order to literally even work from their home becomes a priority and those commodities become essential to IT workers. Some people need to get their glasses/contact lenses replaced so naturally that becomes an essential commodity to them.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe biggest goal for the lockdown should be to reassure people that everything is under control and everything will be available to them and there\\'s no need to panic. The actions taken by the central government by not taking responsibility of this mess screams the exact opposite of what needs to happen. yup...instead of 100 you sell 50. Its a dip not a black hole. Parts of asia and africa and s. America are stable. Yes.\\n\\nAlso my another comment which many might not appreciate tries explain the motives of corporations when they say such things. Do watch the video in below to have another look at the things.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5y453/covid19_crisis_started_with_virus_propagated_by/fo67hd5?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\\n\\nAlso, whatever is said by the B a j a j guy in this context is very close to what Bolsonaro has been saying.\\n\\nMost importantly, desh rehta hai, corporations rehte hain. Parivar nahi rehte. All of these systems are autopoetic systems. As long as the components interact and transform each other the system exists. All the components are replaceable. Components in this case are humans. ....so we achieved what we set out to do. The path of strategy we picked is working. What\\'s the confusion here? And if we aren\\'t dying at the rate they are. Considering the % of populalation they\\'ve seen dying, we would have stood to lose 2.45 lakh people right now. We\\'ve lost 645 as of last count. And it wasn\\'t before corona did you even read it?? at the cost of migrant workers, employment and the economy.\\n\\nNow what? You know one day we have to open the  lockdown. i can easily survive another 3 months of lockdown . but for millions it is a fate worse than death. i bet that made sense in your head How many migrant workers have died? And what would these numbers be, as compared to the overall dead if we had no lockdown? \\n\\nThe United states, at a fourth of our population, has 45000 dead. That would be just under 2 lakh dead for us. With a long way still to go. \\n\\nDo you think we\\'re going to lose that number of migrant workers? \\n\\nAnd without people, the economy and employment numbers don\\'t matter. Those will recover. The dead will not rise again. Us Indians aren\\'t known for our rational thinking. People lack foresight and empathy in India. Which is why we\\'re in the state we are.\\n\\nUnfortunately most people are unable to foresee the shit show that awaits if life isn\\'t set back to atleast a semi normal state.\\n\\nCoronavirus is here to stay. Anybody thinking that riding it out in a lockdown indefinitely will end positively is far separated from reality. so many ..so many .. and its still rising.\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/india/coronavirus-lockdown-run-over-by-a-freight-train-on-long-walk-home/cid/1766932?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tt_daily_twit Run over on long walk home\\n\\nhttps://thewire.in/rights/covid-19-crisis-will-push-millions-of-vulnerable-children-into-child-labour COVID-19 Crisis Will Push Millions of Vulnerable Children Into Child Labour\\n\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-coronavirus-india-migrants/?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=twitter A REUTERS SPECIAL REPORT\\nThe Long Road Home\\nIndia’s migrant workers fall through the cracks of the coronavirus crisis\\n\\nhttps://bihardemocracy.com/aurangabad-dto-beaten-laborer-for-asking-food/ भोजन मांगने पर औरंगाबाद DTO ने मजदूर को पिटा, वायरल हुआ अनिल कुमार सिन्हा का वीडियो\\n\\nhttps://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-lockdown-12-year-old-walks-3-days-amid-lockdown-dies-just-an-hour-from-home-2215346 12-Year-Old Walks 3 Days Amid Lockdown, Dies Just An Hour From Home\\n\\nhttps://hindi.newsclick.in/Corona-Crisis-Reality-of-suicide-and-alleged-Gujarat-model-of-migrant-workers-in-Surat\\n\\nhttps://theprint.in/india/should-we-poison-our-kids-indore-daily-wagers-complain-of-sparse-erratic-food-supply/405235/ ‘Should we poison our kids?’ — Indore daily wagers complain of sparse, erratic food supply\\n\\nhttps://www.bhaskar.com/local/mp/sagar/tikamgarh/news/coronavirus-live-update-127194796.html टीकमगढ़ / 24 दिन से 50 आदिवासियों के परिवारों को नहीं मिला राशन, जानवरों को खिलाने वाले अनाज से बना रहे रोटियां\\n\\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/india/coronavirus-lockdown-chemical-sprayed-into-mouth-worker-dies/cid/1766385?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tt_daily_twit Chemical sprayed into mouth, worker dies\\n\\nhttps://www.telegraphindia.com/india/coronavirus-lockdown-migrant-falls-and-dies-on-pm-modis-turf/cid/1765839\\nMigrant falls and dies on PM’s turf\\n\\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/migrant-labourers-delhi-lockown-india-coronavirus-covid-19-6367511/\\nMigrant’s last earning before suicide: Rs 2,500 from sale of phone\\n\\nhttps://www.bbc.com/hindi/india-52338267?at_custom4=8E01F2F2-817C-11EA-A80E-42A64744363C&at_campaign=64&at_custom2=twitter&at_custom1=%5Bpost+type%5D&at_medium=custom7&at_custom3=BBC+Hindi\\nकोरोना लॉकडाउन: बदायूं में लगातार दूसरे दिन राशन की लाइन में लगी महिला की मौत\\n\\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-youth-dies-after-being-beaten-up-by-police-in-uttar-pradesh/article31375836.ece Coronavirus lockdown | Youth dies after allegedly being beaten up by police in Uttar Pradesh >And without people, the economy and employment numbers don\\'t matter. Those will recover. The dead will not rise again.\\n\\nThat statement is kind of misleading. Yes without people employment and economy don\\'t matter. But if unemployment goes up and businesses close, we are again in a shitty situation. It doesn\\'t make sense to prioritize between health and economy. They\\'re both equally important. An economic crisis will also cause riots, starvation and death. Only browsed through the English links. 5 dead, and one sanitization worker murdered. \\n\\nStill nowhere close to the number of lives saved. \\n\\nWe\\'re still going to see a horrible number of infections and deaths. The whole point of flattening the curve, even if it means that the same number of people get infected irrespective, is to control the number of people who die. The longer this is stretched out, the more capable the hospitals are to deal with the situation. We are trying to avoid being in a spot like italy, where doctors have to take a call on which lives to save. The more capacity we have in the hospitals, the more prepared we are, the more lives we can save. \\n\\nYou should read up about the experiences of all the countries suffering right now. Lock downs are unfortunately the only way to battle this virus till a cure is found. Unfortunately, even if a cure is found tonight, it would take at least 6 months (by the most optimistic estimates) to bring it to market. \\n\\nSo, for all intents and purposes, we\\'re working hard on the cure / vaccine to better deal with the second and third waves. This time around, we\\'re on our own. It is ok to worry about both the economy and the lives of the people.Stop going into a needless back and forth over it if you dont know or cant understand the magnitude of suffering, and count the dead from links, then its rather pointless trying to explain.\\n\\nFlattening the curve for what? Have you seen hospitals in UP? That was my question, what did you do in the time you bought by flattening the curve and whats the plan now.\\n\\nanyways.. stay safe '},\n",

Please understand money is temporary and salvation is permanent.  - Heil Fuhrer \"History will be kinder to me.\" makes so much sense now. Banks do whatever they want when they are not under scrutiny, and when they come in trouble, everyone runs to the government pleading to save the bank.

I know this isn\\'t the same situation, but this and the PMC crisis reminds me of the 2008 meltdown.\\n\\nThe core issue was the banks doing whatever the fuck they want, escaping scrutiny and then the tax payer ending up having to pay them out in the interest of the country\\'s financial integrity.\\n\\nBut unlike the Fed Reserve, I was under the impression that the RBI has strict oversight over banks in India, so this surprising to me. There’s an old Polish joke from the communist era that goes something like this:  \\n  \\nAn old farmer goes in to town to deposit some money to his account, but he is a bit worried, and ask the teller what will happen if the bank goes bankrupt.  \\n  \\n“Well”, the teller answers, “that’s highly unlikely. But if that happens, our main branch in Warsaw will cover all our obligations.”  \\n“But what if the main branch goes bankrupt too?”\\n“Then the Polish central bank will guarantee that you get your money.”  \\n“And if the Polish central bank goes bankrupt?”  \\n“Then the central bank of the USSR will cover all of their debts.”  \\n“And if the central bank of the USSR goes bankrupt?”  \\n“Well”, says the teller, “wouldn’t that be worth 5000 zlotys?” How she managed to go from a school teacher to a finance minister is beyond me It\\'s \\'NO bank\\' now Let me explain this:\\n1. Bank does bad management.\\n2. Bank in bad shape.\\n3. Government acquires the bank at tax payers\\' expense \\n4. Bank Starts improving\\n5.

Fuck man damn, the artist has nailed nirmala\\'s expression in the second panel! :D It boggles my mind that there isn’t any palpable public anger at these senseless bailouts of moribund enterprises with taxpayer money. Our money - yours and mine - is literally being used to prop up banks that made terrible business decisions and should be allowed to fail. Not just banks, our money has been keeping that national embarrassment called Air India alive for who know how many years now. In a country with a more rationally-minded general public, people would be out on the streets in anger. But no, in India people seem to care little about anything other than “Hindu-Muslim, Hindu-Muslim, India-Pakistan”. Not to mention the fact that she blamed the loans given out by Yes Bank during the UPA regime for the downfall.

And who will save me? This is another reason why cryptocurrency is essential Corruption in a bank is rare in most countries. Here, in India, bankers get money for approving loans and that\\'s a problem in India. [removed] In most cases they receive kickbacks for loan. I would give a silver for this comment, If only my money was in a different bank. Yeah you are absolutely right occult-eye. One of my cousins is working for a bank in the screening department of home loan division. He tells me that he uses loads of tools and his analytical ability to evaluate the authenticity of the borrowers.

Not a 5-6 year issue. \\n\\nAll governments in power over the years have a hand in this.\\n\\nEspecially the officials of the RBI. A lot of the banking sector problems are a result of UPA\\'s mismanagement and carelessness.\\n\\nBetter credit tracking introduced in 2016 uncovered a lot of this dirty underbelly and exposed the level of NPAs all these banks had accrued. \\n\\nI know it is fashionable to bash the BJP for anything and everything on this sub but read about the issues for 2mins before posting comments like these. Didn\\'t that cunt chief economic adviser rant how companies shouldn\\'t cry for govt.help all the time and govt. help is only needed in during the young years of business? SBI isn\\'t a purely government bank.then socialising the losses how? Air India is also for sale don’t post incomplete information to suit your narrative If SBI gets a stake in YES Bank, it also gets a stake in its losses. SBI being a govt entity, I\\'ll let you guess where the money to cover it\\'s losses comes from... And it was worth 5000 zlotys.. I am sorry i don’t understand. Can you explain? She might be the most qualified minister in bjp then? [removed] When Modi became managed to go from a tea master to a prime minister, this ain\\'t that surprising. Do you really think she decides policies and all, she is a puppet finance minister just a face for public. All the policies were made my ranga billa and given to her to present it in public Yes bank is private company and she is only doing her work Perfect kick! Now you understand Indians are so easy to manipulate. \\nThat\\'s why Indians have been economically slave for millennia, till this date. [deleted] Not true. This is not uncommon. It is the lack of corporate governance that is the issue here, and applicable to every corporate around the world, including banks. Such bad banking practices have sent many economies into turmoil. Looks like it\\'s our turn now (ಥ﹏ಥ) [removed] I understand completely. \\n\\nThe only place where there are no kickbacks [at least to the banker] is a sperm bank. :) \"Wait,You guys are getting paid (in kickbacks)\"😳 - Credit officer in a PSB \\n\\n\\nNo such kickbacks exist not atleast in these state owned banks.\\n\\nIf you recommend or sanction a credit the only thing you get is a bunch of stupid ass paper works. Stress of it defaulting and you getting a Staff Accountability Letter and the small satisfaction of a actually doing your effing job With me, it is the thought that counts. I will drink a glass of water, assuming it is single malt, bought by you :) But this issue isn’t cause of some guy who wanted a home loan. This is cause they gave away loans to corporates who nobody else would touch at exaggerated rates. Instead of junk bonds, YES bank was hedging it’s bets on junk loans, backing their ability to recover. FM, Ms. Nirmala Sitaraman It is a Scheduled Bank with direct supervision from RBI. The organisation (RBI) used to be autonomous with really good functioning before 2014. But after arrival of you know who, he forced resignations from Raghuram Rajan and even his own appointee Urjit Patel. You know who had to appoint a goddamn History student to keep that autonomy in check. Nobody understands the problems of poor You know who. :( We\\'re talkin abt what happened to it. Not abt it. No man it doesn\\'t work like that I don\\'t wanna explain everything to you here but just think about yes bank has provided loan of lack of thousands crores to the people do you really think they can do that without government approval.\\nprivate bank has to follow RBI guidelines and our central government and finance  department has been playing with RBI like it\\'s a gully cricket .\\nYes Bank\\xa0fiasco is caused by \"mismanagement\" of financial institutions under the BJP\\xa0government\\xa0and RBI should conduct a thorough probe and fix accountability in the matter. A bank like Yes Bank’s balance sheets are subject to inspection by both RBI and the finance ministry every year. They should’ve noticed the signs when their money out on loan was ballooning every year. Gau mutra. [removed] Dude 13 banks went into crisis in his rule. \\nThere was something called as UTI,  check what happened to it? This issue has been grossly mishandled in the last few years especially post demo.

From the rating of assets and corporations to the valuation of securities, everything was interfered with by the FM\\'s office or their banking channel operatives. Case in point - Mr. Vijay Mallya.

Sorry,it\\'s CAR(capital adequacy ratio)\\nIt basically means the asset to liability ratio and is a measure of how safe the bank is in terms of it\\'s financial capabilities\\nIt\\'s set by the central bank(RBI) in India to ensure that liabilities of the bank don\\'t increase beyond a certain point SBI is picking up stakes in the bank and will try to get it back up on it\\'s feet\\nNow a fact about SBI it has assets of 36 lakh crore.To put it into perspective IT HAS THRICE AS MUCH MONEY AS THE REVENUE OF OUR COUNTRY IN A YEAR(which is 12 lakh crore)\\nSo the point I\\'m making is SBI is more than capable of getting YES up on it\\'s feet\\n2nd SBI can\\'t reduce it\\'s 49% stake before 3 years and it isn\\'t going in alone in saving YES but what now we have to look at is who will pick the rest of the stakes in YES.Investors can act either ways they will pick up the stakes quickly because the major stake is being held by SBI and provides stability or they might stay away because of the slowdown and market\\'s high volatility.\\nBut yes people\\'s trust needs to be earned which might take some time so we can say the ball\\'s in SBI\\'s court now.

As it turns out, SBI will. That is what the Government is doing to prevent millions of depositors from losing their deposits, buying out Yes bank.\\n\\nThe cap on withdrawals exist so that all depositors do not withdraw all their money at once. This is called a \\'Bank run\\'. The bank simply does not have cash to pay out all depositors at once. This is the fractional reserve banking system all banks operate in. \\n\\nNow this is the case with Yes bank. Other banks have also had a shit ton of their bad loans uncovered lately but they haven\\'t faced a liquidity crisis. A lot of directives and rules have been imposed by the RBI, starting with CRILC to prevent this shit from happening again.\\n\\nThere is simply not much the Govt can do here other than saving Yes bank by asking SBI or LIC to buy it out and introducing measures so this doesn\\'t happen again. Restructuring is being done by SBI not RBI and SBI earns it\\'s own profits if that\\'s what you\\'re asking Hey statements like that doesn\\'t compute in Bhakt OS 1.4. What I am saying that your first statement is not entirely correct [removed] There are tons of fix:\\n-not blaming UPA is one of them for the current mess\\n-admit that all is not good\\n-revoke CAA and NRC\\n-stop inciting violence\\n-meet economist experts to revive the economy\\n-give internet (not 2G but current spectrum) and other aid to Kashmir\\n-stop misusing police for personal gains\\n-be fair to people and answer their questions\\n-stop controlling press \\n\\nOf course what government did is good, as it avoids Bank Run and also helps bank industry to avoid collapsing but at the same time they should also work to earn the trust of the foreign investors. \\n\\nAbove mentioned points have caused enough disturbance in the nation that it affects foreign investors to invest in the country. So, profits earned by public sector undertaking are spent to recoup losses, a huge part of which is the result of bank officials giving out loans for kickbacks. This is wasted tax payer\\'s money. \\n\\nAlso, the FM announced a capital infusion to revive PSBs. The government will also be infusing capital to keep these alive. How is this not a waste of tax-payer money? [removed] It\\'s directly not tax payer\\'s money.It\\'s governments or rather the SBI\\'s profits that are being infused to revive the banks and bank revival is necessary because you want to do exactly what? Tell common people who have their money in these banks that they fucked up and that they\\'ll never be getting their money back?\\nPSB\\'s need to be revived because common people have their money in these banks and collapsing of these banks only creates more problems than it solves\\nThe government\\'s mistake is in regulating but even they can\\'t enter too soon or it will be termed as encroachment by the government.

Demand doesn't feed people. Do they earn a lot from online advertising? Online subscriptions don't pay much. As far as I know, they earn more from print advertising than from actual sales of newspapers. Advertising is down, and is not likely to pick up soon. This is just the beginning. How many people in India are going to pay for online news ? Journalists don't fund themselves. Traditional media is dying the world over -- especially print. Online media is heavily dependent on ads and ad rates are pathetic in India as it is. You seem to think the people making the decision to fire employees are the ones writing articles. Business side/journalist side are two different things. Reporters don't take calls for their companies. Gotta bailout the real estate people bro.

The deal values Jio at $65.95 billion. The Jio deal will help reduce RIL’s debt burden while for Facebook it gets a firm foothold in a fast-growing huge market. What a clickbait headline. RIL closed in green today while market crashed 1000 points. **BAILOUT AMOUNT COMING IN 3....2.......** Ha ha ha The market can stay irrational as long as you can stay solvent. Please donate to PM Cares to protect our billionaires. You\\'re better off making a Google sheet You\\'re overestimating the \"common man\". People love Mukesh Ambani. Lots of people love Jio because they think it was Ambani paying his dues to the common man.\\n\\nThere is no way I see the people of India not supporting anything that Ambani does. I\\'m not so bullish on super-apps in India.\\n\\nThere\\'s little to no brand loyalty or switching costs in digital in India and Indian customers will migrate to a different product even if it means saving a few paise. This plus an already crowded payments market means even if whatsapp does manage to excel in customer acquisition, there is no moat to preserve this advantage. He will shove his shit down out throats. Poor Amazon and Walmart will have to leave Indian e-commerce market soon. Man how did you know about the Facebook investment? \\\\*longer So from personal experience that I have shared elsewhere before as well -- \\n\\nWe were the first adaptors of JIO - we had about 20+ Sims installed on our IOT devices that were stationed outside on billboards etc. \\nSo as JIO grew the service became abysmal and now we are down to probably 3 sims and will phase out altogether. \\n\\nWe sometimes underestimate the intelligence and overestimate the simplicity (veiled stupidity) of the common man - trust me it ain\\'t so. Even PayTM which was trying to become super-app (is still trying) has gone minimalist with their android app. \\n\\nWhy is Facebook even bothering with the idea of integrating payment with WhatsApp? Just launch an individual app like Google Pay on top of the UPI framework. Market the app with cashback and they will soon get a huge userbase that has logged in with their Facebook account adding some more data points for their advertising business. It had been in the works for a while, the lockdown just delayed the news/final call. Well maybe. It\\'s wrong to over and under simplify. But trust me, a lot of people support Ambani for Jio. And we treat billionaires like they\\'re heroes (tbf that seems to be a global issue). One thing i noticed when i came to india more than a year after Jio was launched is that voice call quality has gone to shit compared to how it was earlier, it was so bad its not even funny. well,id still say anyone who was first adaptors of Jio to that extent is not that intelligent and a little simple. He already got your money.\\n\\nHe\\'s got my money too. Only thing is got is a Jiofi and its been working well enough for my purposes for 5 years. I havent even had to change the dongle.I dont like reliance,but lol,this is country which got a statue stuffed up its ass when it asked for a better economy. I guess something that we all have to decide for ourselves. \\nI don\\'t want JIO to close down as much as I don\\'t want Voda-Idea to close down. There is enough business for both of them and Airtel / BSNL. \\nI just hate when business houses subvert government policies (Jet for instance). '},\n",

I need a usb cable for my phone as the original broke. \\n\\nIf your phone died today, would  a smartphone purchase still be non essential for you. Fuck! Keep the cardboard box or plastic packaging separate, preferably opening the packaging at the doorstep. If you\\'re really germaphobic, use a pair of gloves while handling the package, preferably at the doorstep, and wash them with soap water thoroughly. Use disinfectant spray  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjDuwc9KBps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjDuwc9KBps) \\n\\nHope this helps. wipe everything with a towel soaked in soapwater, even the carton or dispose off the outer covering if not needed just then. again wash your hands before opening any of your products This is a different kind of case tho. From my understanding of the virus , if it\\'s an open area well ventilated or better yet outdoors , the chances of getting infected by the virus through aerosol is negligible as long as you don\\'t spend a long time in proximity to the infected person. So the primary mode of infection in these cases would be droplet meaning sneezes , coughs or even rubbing your eyes after taking your delivery and grabbing it in places where the box might have been exposed to droplets of the virus. \\n\\nIf someone does not have a fever/cold ie they are asymptomatic, the chances of contracting the virus through interaction with a delivery person drops by a lot (provided you take precautions such as washing your hands after opening the package and not touching your face until you have absolutely clean hands). \\n\\nIn this case the guy had a cough and was not tested despite him having the symptoms. ICMR has repeatedly continued saying we don\\'t have community transmission in our country whereas literally every piece of statistical analysis says we have been in such a state for sometime now. This is what happens when the only people being tested are people with a travel history. The guidelines have changed now but not by a lot. \\n\\nTldr - you can\\'t check for community transmission by selectively testing people who have a travel history. https://twitter.com/saahilmenghani/status/1250721251275857920?s=21 I have a cheap Chinese trimmer, brand is Gemei costed me about 650rs been using it for more than a year. It heats slightly when running for a long time but it\\'s absolute vfm. Indeed That\\'s why i said \"urgent\". Obviously, what\\'s essential differs for everyone, especially if it\\'s required for work. Of course if a phone died, we have to buy. \\n\\nMy washing machine broke down and I\\'m manually pulling things to drain water between washes. I won\\'t be ordering new one immediately as it is not really stopping my work or health. what is a disinfectant spray? Agreed Dettol ne naya nikala hai. Ad dekha tha tv pe. '},\n",

Be prepared to fight for your net neutrality, folks. Privacy in today's world is a myth. It's all out there for everyone to see. No one asked anyone to use Facebook, Whatsapp or Instagram. You agree to terms and conditions which includes consent to use targeted or retargeted advertising. If you have a problem just dont use them. thank god i use Airtel I don’t understand why everyone wants Facebook to be like government. You are not paying anything so you can’t expect anything! Dont use it! As simple as that! If you want to use it then be ready to deal with the privacy. Its a very simple concept. [deleted] F Pipe dream You can use most of the good things that Internet offer without signing off your privacy, you know... Lol. Keep dreaming. Did someone ask you to upload your data to any of these? Lol you really think other operators don't sell your data? Regulation of Facebook is as effective as a baseball umpire regulating a cricket game. \\n\\nMy gut feeling on this deal is that Facebook's biased algorithms + Jio's free data are going to work as a massive manipulation engine working in favour of the current government and their agenda. F yes very true. Uneducated much? You know that even Airtel is now pitching for Huawei’s 5G fair point lol [deleted] No one asked anyone to use Facebook, Whatsapp or Instagram. You agree to terms and conditions which includes consent to use targeted or retargeted advertising. If you have a problem just dont use them. But not like Jio+FB would, we all know how they bend in front of government to snoop and hand over all data I don't know why you are getting downvoted, even the worst American company for privacy is better than companies based in China. Taken to court and then what? People impacted by the breach get 1 year of free identity theft monitoring + maybe a couple hundred bucks.\\n\\nAnyway, my concern isn't even about data breach. The point I was trying to make was this deal brings two evil companies together - evil because the current government is headed in a direction where they completely want to control their narrative (and anyone who speaks against them or questions them will be reprimanded immediately). Look at what happened to most of the news networks over the past few years. \\n\\nNews channels + Jio + Facebook + Whatsapp just gives them too much unfair leverage. \\n\\nAlso, a data breach is scary but what is more scary is a government having access to all private data without the user even knowing about it. Idiotic point, I would rather not choose at all if that is the case. Choosing lesser of two evils is stupid. I guess you would definitely remember about Cambridge Analytica case where they harvested  personal data of millions of user profiles of facebook without their consent and used it for political gains.\\n\\nThese things weren't in terms and conditions.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nIf these companies are linking together all of those little tidbits of information about you that you've entered in Whatsapp (personal conversations), Facebook (likes, comments, communities or pages etc), Instagram (followings and likes) with JIO platform.\\n\\nThis data leads to a very detailed personal profile, which greatly helps to personalize direct marketing very specifically to you. This way advertising can be directed to the products and services you have thought about, slowly nudging you and seducing you into a purchase. More dangerous is that such a profile can also be used for political purposes. History has taught us that detailed knowledge of people’s ethnic background and political or religious beliefs can, in the wrong hands, literally be life-threatening. Have you checked EU laws? Exploitative terms and conditions do not apply to Eu citizens and do not overrule their privacy rights. No citizen can realistically read 1000 page license agreements on every piece of software they use. India sadly has no legal framework in place for this field\\n\\nEULA is not the end all and be all. It's not even legally enforceable in many countries That’s incorrect.\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2019/11/12/facebook-admits-to-circumventing-gdpr/ The article describes well what I wrote though. They've just decided to battle in court over it. Ultimately, gdpr fines are trivial to a mammoth like facebook, but atleast users can use the law to wipe their data easily and be comfortable knowing that it won't stay there forever if they stop using it Exactly what are you expecting from Facebook ? All issues with Facebook was known from atleast 5 years. Why people are still using it? So is it facebook’s problem or the user’s problem? Facebook's problem. Not every user is as informed as fellow reddit scholars. There is no legal recourse for users, we are only getting what we got because of EU's laws. This includes digital refund policies too, or rather anything involving digital licensing. There are no proper laws, everything is in limbo \"},\n",

They are no longer flagship killers. They're just flagships. You don't go for OnePlus if you have 42k to spend on a phone. Flagship killer \\\\#neversettle .....removes headphone jack ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\\n\\nKiller becomes flagship, now realme is new oneplus until they can afford RDJ for their ads. Feels good spending EUR 999 for a smartphone now. That's what I get for being born in Europe haha :D Thanks OnePlus! Way too costly to be called a flagship killer. They offer good specs and software updates but the entry point is becoming higher and higher. Not sure how post covid times will treat them. Why doesn't anyone make compact flagship? Didn't get the context.. ? They just made the battery last more while removing individual audio drivers on both buds, which made the predecessor more expensive. Sound quality compromised to achieve a cheaper price tag.. Maybe they felt obligated to, after the massive price increase on their entry-level smartphone. How good are the OnePlus earphones? I was thinking of buying the realme buds wireless, might get OnePlus ones if they're good. Stop comparing Iphone with other phones. They are very different. But Iphone SE will outlast even the OnePlus 8 pro in terms of software support and overall performance because of that beastly A13. Iphone se was launched at 40k so no surprises \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nApple charges 600 $ for a pair of wheels , why even bother One plus 8 isn’t a flagship tho \\n\\n8 pro is Spoken like someone who has never used an iPhone. Flagship is OnePlus 8 pro. OnePlus 8 is premium but not flagship grade. It very clear (to except iFools) that the base OnePlus 8 [beats](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=10161&idPhone2=10170) the iPhone SE 2020. Same girl, been using my OnePlus 5 for 3 years and it's fit as a fiddle How is the performance? \\n\\nDon't say Snappy because everything seems fast... What then? Realme?? Come on bro... Sony tried and failed. It's the name of their BT earphone Where did you get that they removed the audio drivers ? Waiting for the review I haven't personally used an iPhone because I abstain from them but my cousin who had a 7Plus and now X, has nothing but good things to say and whenever I make a defense for overpriced Android phones uses the same points I mentioned above. The thing is the OnePlus will only receive software and security. updates until 2022-23 max while deteriorating in performance as time goes by. I blame Android for that primarily but hey it's not like OnePlus has a choice here.\\n\\nThe iPhone can see itself lasting for a good 4-6 years with a the same or marginally less performance difference than when bought.\\n\\nDespite being the less better phone, I can see why ppl prefer the SE than the OnePlus 8 or 8Pro. But the chip in cheapest iphone is more powerful than the Most expensive chip available on android Privacy, A13, software updates, primary camera, LTE bands for foreign trips. The A13 processor benchmarks faster than even a Samsung S20 on single core perform and is almost equal on multicore. Apple's memory is also significant higher quality and faster than anything OnePlus ever assembled. Specs rarely ever equate to real world performance. In practice and daily usage the iPhone will most likely be faster and smoother. Probably wait for the tests. There's a good chance the cheapest iPhone will outperform all Android devices out there. Never hangs. No lags. Quick camera. Runs any game/app. Great battery. Lemme know what else do you want to know? XR is a better option.. it's gonna last much longer. I was asking about your comment - 'Thats the spirit'! Bullets wireless 2 had 2 Knowles balanced armature drivers and a 10mm Dynamic drivers with support for AptX HD support and Qualcomm cVc features which made it more expensive. And this was particularly highlighed when they launched it.\\n\\n\\nBut in case of Bullets wireless Z, there was no mention about the audio drivers, but some of this data was presented on their overview page for the product. It is indicated that the earphones have a 9.2mm dynamic driver with a super bass tone.\\n\\nOther than that, there is no mention of AptX HD support or Qualcomm’s cVc noise cancellation features. This is where OnePlus was able to cut costs. Don't forget the camera quality. OP camera quality is shit. The photos you see on the internet uses professional editors. But do you really want a phone to last 4-6 years? Even phones from a couple years ago look ancient and ugly. I think OnePlus would support LTE bands in most countries the camera difference trumps everything, also OP does get software updates for a longer than avg. time (comp. other OEMs) Sounds good... How long has it been? Does it still get software and security updates? If the downvotes weren't enough the 720p screen, brick like feel, single camera and obnoxious front should be enough. He probably is trying to compare with airpods and is impressed with price. Check the specsheet. It has one 5G band compared to 5 or so in Europe and NA. And far fewer LTE bands. 3ish years ..getting 2 month old security updates. No software updates since Android 9. That's a bummer.. > Android 9\\n\\nDeal breaker. This phone will not be updated anymore. Yeah well, I don't expect updates too. It's only 1 year old software and pretty much as fast as it was new. \\nFor 33k phone 3 years back, I'm very happy with how well it has aged.

That's more than fair. People are losing their jobs or having pay cuts. At this point it's a privelege to have a job that's still paying you as you would. Great move by tcs! Best company what is the entry-level salary at TCS these days ? still 3.15 LPA ? TCS had  bumper profits last year and yet provided less than 9% increment. This year also they performed well and didn't pay up. Yet they are giving dividend to the shareholders mainly because major share holder is Tata Trusts.\\n\\nThis calamity affects IT a lot less than other industries like auto, oil, retail etc. They should have given increments as it is based on FY 19-20 performance abd profit.\\n\\nTCS anyways hires for bench strength and pays dime for a dollar they earn. TCS not laying off employees is not a favor to the employees. To even think of laying off employees is actually disgusting, for any company. There are always many other ways to come out of tough situations.\\n\\nEven not giving hikes is a ridiculous move. The company has made amazing profits recently. Moreover, 90% employees are working from home, and company's savings because of this are huge. Shukriya mai baap Why not defer the increments instead of outright canceling it for one year? But I guess Indian IT companies won't get a better excuse than a pandemic That’s actually very good of them. I am one of the 40000 new employee. Good to hear they are not laying off anyone. I wouldn't call them best. But this was a good step. Should be 3.16. They've got two roles 3.5lpa for standard Devs and 7lpa for good coders. 7lpa is not a bad salary but the quality of work and learning is still shitty from what I've heard. It was 3.36 in 2017. >This calamity affects IT a lot less than other industries like auto, oil, retail etc.\\n\\nIT is a support industry. If other industries are crumbling,  where will generate the funds from?\\n\\nThere is banking IT, Fintech IT , IT supporting Oil industry, IT supporting govt. \\n\\nIT support things , its a piller . It has to get money from some thing else. All the external industries are  in bad shape now. \\n\\n>TCS had bumper profits last year and yet provided less than 9% increment. This year also they performed well and didn't pay up. \\n\\nCTC will be agreed between employers and employee ahead of the year. There is a rating system and the increments will be based on assessment. \\nWhen inceement is already based on performance and negotiation , what made you to make the above statement. \\n\\nComparing to 2008 where many companies reneged on  the offer letter, this one is much better.\\n\\n>They should have given increments as it is based on FY 19-20 performance abd profit.\\n\\nAnd they should start firing as the situation look bleak the coming year? >Moreover, 90% employees are working from home, \\n\\nThey are carriying out existing work .   Upcoming work  will depend on the clients and their situation. Its based on the estimations they take call on hiring policy. They aren't being charitable. They still have a healthy business despite all the downturn. Their revenue actually increased most recently. Wish you all the best for your career . damn! it was the same a couple of years ago Unlike other industries IT has high percentage of people working from home.\\nIT services are still functioning, You just don't realize it, You still have access to Internet banking for example. People working for foreign clients already work remotely. People working for domestic clients are shifting to wfh. \\nThe revenues will be less in year FY 20-21 but nothing compared to other industries which are completely shut.\\nThis increment is  based on previous year not this year.\\n\\nCTC and increment has no relation whatsoever,  TCS has surplus cash, Last year was a bumper profit for TCS, increments are based on these profits, Yet TCS did not give enough increment i.e they saved money for bad times just like our govt does wrt oil. \\n\\nAnyways why am I explaining all this, when someone outside this industry is not going to understand. I understand your point. But, the company IS still exploitative in many ways. Last month, when employees had to move their desktops home, they had to fill physical forms with details of their desktops and stand in queues in multiple departments to get the forms stamped and signed. Hundreds of employees had to queue up in tight spaces, where people coughed and sneezed in really close vicinity. This was all done to prevent Coronavirus. They had 4 months of time to digitize a simple solution, but they didn't.\\n\\nTalking about bonuses and increments, there is a rating system, which is completely biased. Many employees who have stayed on bench for extended periods have got better appraisals than those who have worked their asses off in projects. In projects too, there are bell-curve systems because of which, somebody definitely has to get good appraisals and somebody bad irrespective of their work performance. There have even been times, when ratings were given to employees by managers who never even worked with them or knew about their work. 8 years ago. Can confirm. >Unlike other industries IT has high percentage of people working from home. \\n\\nIT is a support industry.  They always  work for some one who is not IT. Working from home is not a proof of revenue. \\n. \\n\\nWork from home is a stopgap approach to continue existing work on temporary basis due to the sudden spread of disease. \\n\\nBut the work is designed before pandemic. It has to continue until further assessment.   West , which is the main source of work , came to halt. Outsourcing will too. \\n\\nYour notion that IT is independent of other industry is wrong.  Without other Industries running,  What will they outsource to IT? Who will pay when there is no work.\\n\\n\\n>Last year was a bumper profit for TCS, increments are based on these profits, Yet TCS did not give enough increment \\n\\nBonus and hikes are based on performance and market situation . if market situation is worse, there won't be much. \\n\\nhikes are good for better performers. But they aren't for all. people who are performing bad will get fired while better performers are getting bonuses. never heard of cash cow departments and loss making divisions paying the same increments. >Last month, when employees had to move their desktops home, they had to fill physical forms with details of their desktops and stand in queues in multiple departments to get the forms stamped and signed.\\n\\nThis is an unplanned event.  To send any internal asset out, they need to assign responsibility.  Filling form is one of it.   Large firm size means large queues. Employees can maintain physical distance while getting it stamped.

No , im not talking about quantity of work. \\n\\nAnyway few companies are doing away with them so , will see how it goes. Its been there for decades , its  not a new problem.\\n\\n>There have even been times, when ratings were given to employees by managers who never even worked with them or knew about their work.\\n\\nWe are talking about  TCS no firing policy and their decision to honor  40k issued offer letters despite the situation . Which is good for  the people who are staying back. \\n\\nEmployees who want to move out , they need to negotiate on the same baseline so its not very helpful for them . There  wont be many people moving out unless the situation improves. That’s insane! I guess they haven’t heard about inflation Do you work at TCS?\\nI think you do not understand what you are talking about.\\nPlease stop lecturing on something you do not know about.\\n\\nJust take a look at these comments :\\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-not-to-lay-off-employees-freezes-salary-hikes/comment/75186431.cms\\n\\nYou have absolutely no idea about how IT industry functions. There are contingency funds. INR is getting devalued which will lead to increased profits. Again IT industry has not HALTED for god sakes. WEST has not halted completely, IT SERVICES are still functioning, albeit at reduced capacity but its effect will be reflected in next years revenue, at that time they can decide about increment for that year.\\n\\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1247160505065562113?s=20) >IT is a support industry.  They always  work for some one who is not IT. Working from home is not a proof of revenue. .\\n\\nTCS mostly offers services to large companies. Their clients are too big to stop all the work. If anything, they'll be happy to let TCS pick up more work and reduce their own employee strength to manage short-term costs. See we can argue over things for long. I'm not too sure whether you work in TCS or not. Only somebody who an employee can truly understand the pain of little things which happen everyday, again and again.\\n\\nThe decision to allow desktops to be taken home ofcourse required atleast some planning and execution. It takes just a couple of hours to add a basic micro-application to an employee portal. Do you know how much pressure each department had to face because of physical forms? They could've had heart attacks because of that and yes I'm serious.\\n\\nAlso, let me tell you that this all was faced by the lower level employees. The managers and leaders were absent from the offices the entire time and enjoyed the privilege to work from home, while their teams suffered.\\n\\nThe employees could maintain physical distance? Don't you think that's too much to expect from people in a panic situation? It is all very easy to type here buddy, really tough to implement in actual scenarios.\\n\\nI am absolutely proud of TCS for honouring their job offerings. But I am not proud or happy for a hundred other tiny things that they do internally, which impacts employees' physical, mental and financial states but are unknown to the outside world, because again, you say a word, you lose your job and reputation. TIL , one need to work on TCS to talk about IT industry.\\n\\n>Do you work at TCS? I think you do not understand what you are talking about. Please stop lecturing on something you do not know about.\\n\\nAnd how about  the comment that they  paid dividends to the investors to with the profits claim . \\n\\nAnd your source of knowledge is random comments on an economic times article?\\n\\n>Just take a look at these comments :\\n\\n\\nPoint me to the below where I said IT industry came to halt or delete  your account.\\n\\n>Again IT industry has not HALTED for god sakes. I agree ,   above person was telling that   IT industry survives irrespective of others failing, and they must provide increments this year too.\\n\\n\\nI was trying  to explain him there is no such thing as standalone IT thing, \\n\\nFunction of IT is to support  non IT functions. Its not a revenue generator for any industry. It has to run as lean as possible. \\n\\nAnd also was telling that working from home is not a proof of industry  surviving , but continuing the ongoing work as a bcp measure.\\n\\n\\nIndustry's  survival depends on  post pandemic assessments.\\n .\\nNot every thing fails, and  not every thing fails at once.its too soon to tell. >Do you know how much pressure each department had to face because of physical forms? \\n\\nSpeed of execution .  Its cheaper and faster to take a quick printout and get it stamped  than developing a tamperproof online portal.\\n\\n>The employees could maintain physical distance? Don't you think that's too much to expect from people in a panic situation?\\n\\nYou get it stamped and get out. You are done. Why panic? Are you not attending fire drills regularly? \\n\\nIf  physical distance is too much to expect  , do not complain about cramped places. Cramped places are result of not maintaining distance .  Let me know if employees were made to outside stand in blistering heat .\\n\\n>I am absolutely proud of TCS for honouring their job offerings.\\n\\nThats all the point .  This is not a survey about your day to day problems at work.\\n\\nThis is about TCS honoring job offerings and saying they dont lay off people due to pandemic.  \\n\\nIf you are good with it, its good. \"},\n",

Visibility by commenting for upvotes It’s the deadline to pay the taxes, not to file returns.\\n\\nEDIT: This thing: https://www.icicibank.com/knowledge-base/tax/advance-tax.page, something salaried people don’t really have to worry about. It\\'s the deadline for a late return i was gonna comment this I doubt any politician actually pays taxes in India....the fact no one brings this question up is even more weird. It’s the deadline to pay taxes That’s what people said for the gst 3b deadline, and October /August deadline too because that time there was some other situation and people wanted extension. Nirmala was silent throughout and didn’t even communicate or extend anything . \\n\\n\\nThey can inform people few days before so that people can have peace of mind.\\n\\nThey may announce it at the last moment and waste peoples time I just want it be announced asap. Because my senior actually went to work today and I might get called tomorrow. Just want this to end tbh That\\'s not a bell actually, thats the amount of care she has for the people of india. Can\\'t kill whats already dead But isn\\'t karma fuzzed? Someone downvoted him, i reupped him to 69 hi5 If you are salaried then you must be having tax deducted at source by your employer. In that case you will only have to worry about tax filing which usually has deadline July/August. If you have any other income source which has not been taxed, pay the tax now. It\\'s the due date. I don\\'t understand how everyone here so financially illiterate There have been numerous instances in the past when the govt has extended deadlines, and frankly every year the deadline is being extended for one reason or another.\\n\\nEven in the worst case, if the deadline passes, you can either do the filings with penalty or write to govt. to waive off the penalty.\\n\\nAlso, why is your senior going to work? If you are called tomorrow, why don’t you refuse? Is s/he/Are you part of essential services? Have you seen the slew of notifications issued by the govt in this regard? \\n\\nYou can’t put everything on the govt, pal. There has to be an application of mind on your side as well.\\n\\nThese are extraordinary times and the govt is working with a skeletal staff(<50% Gp B and C employees and having shortage of officers already) having to deal with a million things simultaneously. \\n\\nI am not expecting you to do their jobs for them or not having better expectations from your govt, but such expletive laden entitled demands reek a little bit of insensitivity and hell-with-you-what-about-me attitude. ministry or people? Oh boy What is dead may never die. Here\\'s poor mans gold🏅 for you. Nice I did file it with my employer but my HRA was rejected because I forgot to upload my rent agreement in the uploaded zip file. \\n\\nSo HRA I\\'ll have to file ITR I believe. The last date for that is March 31st? \\n>I don\\'t understand how everyone here so financially illiterate\\n\\nIronic.\\n\\n31st March is the due date for belated returns i.e. those who didn\\'t file their returns by 31st July, 30th Sep, 30th Nov. \\n\\nSo, 31st March is the due date for FY 2018-19. \\n\\nAnd believe me, I\\'m speaking from experience. TONS of people file belated returns. [deleted] Ooh people. Sorry. But rises again, harder and stronger. Thankyou :) You can get tax refund, don\\'t worry. ITR for salaried individuals usually starts in April every year. See if your employer accepts it. If not, then there\\'s no need to worry. File ITR in April and claim a refund, you would get it.\\n\\nSince you have never filed an ITR, I would suggest to learn about it first and then discuss if you have any questions. It is also the due date for paying 100% of advanced taxes, i.e for actually paying your taxes for those who pay it themselves (self employed individuals, businesses, etc). If you owe more than 10k tax while filing your returns in July or August then there’s a significant penalty. -\\tIt will be extended. Won’t be the first time.\\n\\n[And it just did..](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/nirmala-sitharaman-live-announcements-on-compliance-issues-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-11585034625270.html)\\n\\n-\\tI can’t think of a single reason why ‘Nirmala won’t want it’. Let me know if you can think of one. Any good learning sources where I can start? Thanks. There are few YouTube channels who have explained properly. I would update the comment if J remember the channel\\'s name.\\n\\nRead articles on cleartax, it would give you an idea. '},\n",

Those morons (even some britishers) think that EIC did us a favour by building railways and cities and that we could have never done that without them. _facepalm_\\n\\nBut I am curious, without colonisation, would India be a single country in modern times? Or would we be something like Europe? A few hundred trillion plundered and millions murdered.... For a few rusty trains? Worst trade deal in history.

I think we should look closer to South America, who also experienced imperial colonization, to see what we'd look like.

This question should not ever be asked seriously. A conservative “likely” scenario: It’d be a bunch of princely states, some of whom would be annexed by the French, Dutch, or Japanese over the course of the 20th century. Some might even have gone towards Communism or Islamism. Post WW2, many would have achieved independence only to become pawns in the Cold War. I would think he'd agree but he didnt. He doesn't. He thinks they were mostly a force of good He did say something about Shahjahaan wasting money on Taj Mahal or something I don't think he is sanghi. Just someone who is pretty conservative. Well, he said he will vote Modi even ig Modi joins congress I feel he is more gullible and has given into Modi = India and Anti Modi = Anti India image rather than the attitude of Sanghi. This is from what you said. Maybe he is a Sanghi\\n\\nHopefully he can see the light in future before it is too late.\\n\\nWell maybe it actually is too late for India. Maybe \"},\n",

Every time it says transaction failed because the bank is not responding I read that in Darth Vaders voice SBI won\\'t be working when the state of the world is stable. So no need to include it in situations like this. ICICI not working, tried today 2 hours ago I cannot activate my Gpay account linked to my HDFC account They should be working fine, SBI net banking infra is great in my experience Probable causes: Network traffic, no personnel to keep the servers running. Airtel App probably. Yes Since all banks are classified under essential services, and Govt Business is mandated for them, I suggest you go to your nearest branch and give them a cheque towards your NPS contribution GREAT!! Thanks 👍🏽👍🏽 This is on mobile *every ONE UI phones Oh so that\\'s what scroll was for. Never tried it Last night I tried but not responding after few try it worked. That might be difficult as police aren\\'t allowing people on street. Also, I was *opening* the account. So I don\\'t have a PRAN yet. Where will that cheque even go?\\n\\nI still went to bank today for something else. Needed my online banking user id/password combo since I\\'ve forgotten that. I use mobile banking but it has limited facilities. Hence wanted to dive into net banking. But they literally told me that their systems are not working until March 31st so I should come after that. I am in awe. We are supposed to use the digital facilities but they will be down for one more week? Hurray :/ Welcome always! *For mobile, this feature exist in many OS*.  Eg; [MIUI has Scroll Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/T2Z7T01.png).\\n\\nThe query was about how it could be done on Laptop. Yes....\\nAll banks have been instructed that only transfer, cash deposit/withdrawal and govt business activities be carried out till 31st March.\\nDid you open a NPS account through a bank?\\nAlso a NPS account should ideally have a PRAN My bad I didn\\'t read his comment about laptops 😅 No, I was opening it through eNPS website which is where my bank site redirected me. Thing is, since I am at home now, I thought I would take care of a few financial ends. The bank branch near me didn\\'t have NPS opening facility. At least no one knew there. So I thought, I would do it myself. The registration process is fairly straight forward if a bit lengthy. After completing the details, only payment was remaining. And the process tells you that PRAN is only generated after payment is done. And since my attempts are failing, I don\\'t have it. I was hoping that FY20190-20 would be extended but it hasn\\'t been. Let\\'s see... I will keep attempting. *Nothing to feel bad about* !  Stay safe.. '},\n",

Hmm I\\'m not sure if I understand your idea. could you explain it a bit further? how does it would work?\\n\\nAlso, there is a list by companies page: [https://knowyourworth.site/#/companies](https://knowyourworth.site/#/companies) Yeap totally agree, I already have this feature in my list. I usually depurate the submissions myself, but a report feature would be really useful. Thanks for your suggestion! I just added a way to report salaries. If you find some one that looks fake don\\'t doubt to report it. Thanks again! Thank you, glad you like it! You should select country: India, and inthe region field put: \\'Remote\\',  thanks! I respect your opinion, but I\\'d like to add to comments: First, it is anonymous, so yes you are sharing your payscale but you are not sending any contact info, so what harm I could do with your info?. Second, I can\\'t see how sharing it with Glassdoor is a better idea than sharing it on this site? \\n\\nAlso, I know there are other similar sites, but they are focused on the USA or big Companies only (I\\'m from Uruguay and Glassdoor is useless here), and there are too complex for me, that\\'s why I decided to build something simpler like this. You can share your salary in 2 mins without giving your credentials. So suppose I want to share my salary detail  and I am the first person from the company named \"shyama international pvt ltd\" todo so. \\nSo website will not show me a drop down list and I would enter the company name.\\n\\nNow if a second person comes.and shares his detail,   he will also not be shown choice and in company name he fill SIPL in short.\\n\\nAt your end, you will get two data for same.company but still treated as separate (my guess, correct me.if I am wrong)\\n\\nA solution to this would be: Go to greatPlaceTowork website and fetch names of companies listed there.\\nWhen someone tries to enter company, always show him complete list to choose from.\\n\\nWhile filtering, you may add  a check that dont reveal company name in drop down list if Number of entries are less than 3.\\n\\nThis has two benefits:\\n1. Names of companies in your database will bs correct\\n2. while filling salary, a user will not hesitate to fill his data thinking that he will not be able to filter his company average salary as he is among first three user. He will be motivated enougb to complete the survey as his company name is also there. No problem. I like this resource. Will be better with more and more entries. Great! I\\'ll do it for sure. Got it, great idea. I\\'ll add it to my ToDo list, thank you very much for taking your time to explain it and for your feedback ! I know but everything start small. You can share yours and encourage others to do it, so you\\'ll be helping and making the site more useful. Thanks! '},\n",

Isn't that the option RBI is giving the common man with loan liabilities? ahh i was wondering when this going to crop up \\\\\\n\\n nearly all business contracts have this clause but am guessing this will be contested in courts globally. Reliance was always a scum They have to contribute to PM-CARES fund.... Where will they get the money if not from someone else's pocket? OMG! PVR unable to pay rent? I think the money they charge for fucking popcorn alone was enough to fund a space program. I think PVR can manage rent only from popcorn money Your landlord has your deposit. So, a month down the line, you'll lose both the rent and be homeless. Big corporate players have the legal muscle to pull this off, we don't. Yes, some states have given one month grace period to migrants living in rented apartments. Look it up Yes you can if you are in Tamil Nadu\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.thenewsminute.com/article/tn-govt-announces-one-month-rent-freeze-action-can-be-taken-if-house-owners-disobey-121552 Stuck in the same dilemma, was living in a PG in a different city. Travelled back home some days before curfew was announced, now the landlord says I gotta pay rent even though I've mostly vacated my room.  technically you can stop if your rent agreement has Force Majeure clause in it but am sure this be will highly contested in courts in coming days. Have you stopped staying in your house because of Corona? Did you just pull an OMG scene here 😝 How did you remember the name? Underrated comment this. Exactly, Defer is for Common Man\\n\\nRich and Powerful Get Waiver Deferment is an out of the contract favor your bank is granting to you. Waiver is a right that they have under the agreement that they are exercising. How can one pay rent if business is not in operation? This should be for all commercial businesses. You'll still have to pay the rent though only a month later. With a PG it is easy. Depending on how much is the stuff that is still there worth and your deposit amount, you could just ghost your landlord.\\n\\nIs it the right thing to do? Apne gruh maj jhaak ke dekho. Have the movie theaters stopped renting because of Corona? act of god i guess :p Capitalism for the poor.\\n\\nSocialism for the rich. Sadly this comment will be lost. I know it's there because that's how the contractual agreement has been negotiated. The juxtaposition is what's interesting. An individual isn't protected from the act of god but a corporation is. Based on profits made from previous months and years and Money saved from tax breaks got from state and local governments. hence the term grace period, and not forgiven! Most Theaters are closed due to govt order. A large corporation with hundreds of lawyers working for it would obviously be able to negotiate a better deal for itself than an individual. That didn't answer my question. It does. You are still using your home in this situation. The movie theatres cannot use their property. That's a key difference. I dont think it matters to the owner of the mall or property where the cinema is at. It matters to the user. That's why you have such clauses in the agreement. \\n\\n'Act of God' is not something they conjured up in their sleep. It is a well defined legal argument with thousands of precedences. Didn’t know that. I’ll take my comment back. \"},\n",

Apparently Cowpathy has a range of products. And then you will be eating out of the plate washed by Cowpathy\\'s herbal dishwasher made from distilled first urine of the cow for the day. Extra fine virgin urine for the nature lover in you. Distilled Cow urine = Water without goodness of Cow urine 😁😬 One definition of veganism is:\\n\\n>Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals \\n\\nCows make milk for themselves, same with chickens and eggs, bees and honey. You are exploring the creature when you take those by-products. \\n\\nCows don\\'t want the urine. So it seems to me that if you\\'re naturally catching cow urine (and not like keeping the cows around for it) it could *possibly* be vegan. \\n\\nBut if the cow is being kept for the milk, it\\'s being exploited. Right, cow urine probably has some bacteria and stuff the we kill during distillation or still lives and make their way into the final product. 🤔 Add some Bhang and a new beverage for Sanghis ! What if corona is the restart ngl that is one hot trash sub Time to leave a review. Hello there Wash eyes with Cowpatty products Eat and drink cow urine and dung. Hopefully it will do enough brain damage. Or if you are lucky you will die of typhoid/cholera. They also have cow dung soap That\\'s the thing, though - given the number of bhakts and the quantum of bhakti going around, you\\'d think that this product would go out of stock before the real sanitizers do. But no.\\n\\nSeems to me that when push comes to shove, the bhakts are the first ones to dump their so-called superior traditions and just take refuge under western science. I know a couple who are close relatives: they spend all their time bad-mouthing western medicine and extolling the virtues of Ayurveda. Until one of them gets a sore throat or cough, at which point they go to the nearest medical store and buy a couple of sheets of amoxycillin. Yep, antibiotics, self-medicated. Err...poo. Cow poo to be exact. Ahem. Rs100 Cowpathy Hand Sanitizer 50ml (Pack of 2) https://www.amazon.in/dp/B078Y4QZZV/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_K.WzEb027HE66  you can have it for free .

No scientist will waste their time on convincing retards.\\n\\nEven if you publish your results, how do you expect those \"पढ़े लिखे गवार\" morons to understand you? Water with gomatha blessings It\\'s not....Just false marketing Haha. People just don\\'t know that emoji in the title is frowned upon in Reddit. Maybe more popular subredits folks know about this unsaid practice, just not here I guess. **ISIS** mark Maybe so! But, “Cowpathy” is a misnomer I believe. It should be “ Cowpatty”!💩👍🏾 They should have also added \"non GMO\" I would prefer to get infected by coronavirus rather than getting std from cow urine. The urine itself is not vegan. Veganism avoids the use of all animal products unless absolutely essential. Distilled Urine is just water 😁 By that definition, curd isn\\'t vegan either xD WEED ENERGY!! then corona would be like the begnning of the end. or the God\\'s way of foreshadowing something badf about to happen. FUck god is Shakespeare General Kenobi!! Plus Rs.80 for delivery charges ! Correct. I\\'ll be tagged intolerant of \"harmless practices\", like some twitteratti defended the nimbumirchi practice like that a while ago. 🐮 Is it ? Or is someone else a whatsapp university graduate cowtatty >vegan\\n\\nif its really cow urine how can it be vegan when it comes from an animal It isn\\'t. Milk and milk products are not vegan You seem to be confused between Vegan and Vegetarian It isn\\'t \"in sooth I know not why I am so sick\" -sickspear, merchant of Venice Nope sorry you guys are doomed cowpotty It’s another mystery of the universe... ✨ or else, just dishonest advertising.

So finally Daft Punk will be available? Pehle wala thik se sign nahi hua tha kya. Seems like an april fools joke to me. good to subcribe now ? or is there any other catch ? Can I expect Iron Maiden or not? When do the changes start reflecting? As of now there is no change YouTube music still has better catalogue in India imo. What new Indian songs will be on Spotify from this deal? *Laughs in Spotify AU* I don't care as long as they have Honey singh Gaana is available for a year at 299 and 150 for students. Is Spotify really that worth it? David Bowie,Madonna, Linkin Park, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Ed Sheeran, coldplay ,The Doors , Bruno Mars, Cardi B are some major artists.\\n\\nAnd in addition spotify has also signed deals with Saregama. Linkin Park is signed with Warner Bros Records for one Coldplay, GreenDay, et.al Dimmu borgir I'm not sure That was Warner Chappell, one of the subgroups. This is the bigger one which includes most major Warner artists. Pehle wala alag tha. Self censorship is still there Yep, its there Well, if anyone listen only to hindi music ,I don't think spotify is worth it.You tube music is best of the bunch as far as I have tried.\\nBut if you are intrested in anything beyond that and want to discover splendid new music then its defenitely worth it .There is always a high probability that you will find many great music in your  daily mix and especially in weekly mix . The magic of Spotify is the recommendations engine. The sound quality is close second. For the sheer quality of sound itself, Spotify is worth it. \\n\\nPlus, you get top of the line music recommendations based on listening pattern, introducing new music. \\n\\nGaana doesn’t have those features. Guess, we get for what we pay for. worth it only for english music and customized playlists and background tracks, lo fi, meditation music etc Spotify Students is around ₹60 AFAIK. Spotify's global catalog, interface and quality is unmatched by gaana. Don't know why you're getting downvoted, it's a genuine question.\\n\\nSpotify has a MUCH bigger library, the biggest when it comes down to Western, Latin American, and most libraries. Because of this, you get access to far more obscure artists. The way this works is, the app has to strike a deal with a publisher to license their songs. The problem with gaana, wynk, hungama, etc. is that they will only strike deals with mainstream publishers(like WMG, Interscope, etc), and sometimes only mainstream artists under the publishers as it's cheaper, as these songs are most likely to be listened to. Also, being desi platform, they won't give as much focus as Spotify to other libraries. Because of this a lot of artists are unavailable across these platforms. Also, they have a far more refined UI/UX and support much higher streaming quality. Their app also has a couple of features you wouldn't find on most desi services.\\n\\nSo, Spotify is not worth it if you mainly listen to Indian genres, and only listen to mainstream English. Pretty bold of you to keep Cardi B along with those legends. I was not gonna renew my sub after free 3 months trial, but now  I can already see myself leaning towards the other side. The Doors are not there sadly, I checked first thing that came to my mind 😅 Abey bohot hai Comment kyu kia? What does an audio platform censor? Source? Which songs? I had the privilege of using Pandora, and trust me Spotify doesn't even cut close. It was easily the best recommendations algorithm I've experienced. I hope they buy Pandora in the future or something Wait whaat? I didn't know India had a student plan Yes, exactly what I thought. Gaana is amazing for Indians. They have absolutely everything you need, so I just thought to ask why all this fuss about Spotify. Now after downvotes and every answer I came to know I am the only one who likes regional music over western here and everyone else is cool here :( Lol,I was just saying with respect to popularity. If we're going along that path then Madonna, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Bruno Mars are also out of place. Lol coldplay and Ed Sheeran shouldn't be there either What's the point of getting a subscription in India? You already get unlimited skips only thing I can think of are the annoying ads Well,they are there 😀 As far as I know ,Elektra record was under warner music.Anyway It would be sad then ,coz among all the artists mentioned the doors were the first whom l listened extensively. Fuck yeah Linkin Park. I'm jobless Lot of songs have slangs and swears that get censored on Spotify India https://www.spotify.com/in/student/ Is this the new cool thing? To hate coldplay, ed and bruno? I must be out of  loop. I can download my playlist, no ads and also I have a student ID so it's just 59 pm for me. Yesss, now they are there, they werent when I checked previously. They are slowly updating. Thats a relief. God! So they don't have an explicit and children's version? Not hating, just stating that they don't hold the same legend status (IMO) as the other artists on the list. Yeah it unfortunately is , Even though i only listen to classic rock i don't go around lecturing how pop music sucks ( which it doesn't) and that i was in the wrong generation or something . Some people like to feel elitist about themselves through a music identity \"},\n",

       "  'body': 'Lets learn something being at home. Any doubts you can message me.\\n\\nIf you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .\\n\\nThe real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.\\n\\nSo, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.\\n\\nSo, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.\\n\\nWe will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:\\n\\n1.\\xa0Share Market\\xa0–\\nI just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .\\n\\nJust search in google : reliance share price\\n\\nAt that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.\\n\\nCompany list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.\\n\\nThe broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.\\n\\nFor example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. \\n\\n\\n\\n2. Mutual Fund :\\nMutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.\\n\\nThey are of different types:\\n\\ni. Equity Mutual fund:\\n\\nEquity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.\\nThere are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.\\nA index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.\\n\\nIf someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.\\n\\nii. Debt fund:\\nDebt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.\\n\\niii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.\\n\\nFor a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.\\n\\nThere are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their\\xa0coin.zerodha.com\\xa0to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.\\nYou can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.\\n\\nYou may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.\\xa0Insurance\\xa0:\\nInsurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:\\n\\ni. General insurance\\nGeneral insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like\\n\\nFirst party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid\\n\\nThird party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid\\nThese are compulsory in india.\\n\\nii. Life insurance\\n\\nLife insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.\\n\\na. Health Insurance:\\nHealth insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense\\n\\nb. Term Insurance:\\nTerm insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…\\n\\nBut only death benefit, else you won’t get money.\\n\\nc. Endowment Plans:\\n\\nIf you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.\\n\\nOr if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.\\n\\nYou get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.\\n\\nBasically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges .

       "  'comments': \"Thank youuuuuuuu soooooo damnnnnnnn muchhhhm. Really appreciate it mate.\\n\\nYesterday only i was wrapping my head around this as i was thinking of investing in mutual funds as per my friend's reccomendation but was not very clear with everything.\\n\\nCan you please add an example as well for mutual funds For more related information, r/indiainvestments\\n\\nOP fine work, thanks buddy. Wouldn't it be better to invest in Mutual Funds via something like Kuvera, PayTM Money, Groww, Goalwise etc? Any of these non demat platforms instead of Zerodha, which I believe stores them on Demat account? >  So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.  \\n  \\nwhat?  why? That's a really informative text for all those who want to get into mutual funds.  I really like the way you have covered all the different types. Thank you for sharing. Just one question is this some kind of affiliate marketing ?   \\n[https://zerodha.com/open-account?c=ZMPWDJ](https://zerodha.com/open-account?c=ZMPWDJ)  \\n\\n\\nWhat is ZMPWDJ ? While this is nice, is there like a good book or something where I can really read up on finance and understand the underlying details about it as well instead of gaining just high level basics ? Thank you so much! Example means ,see go to any app - rating agency app like morning star ,or \\n\\n\\nApps like paytm money /kuvera or any other they will show you in example . Invest or don't invest it's free to check. There are multiple types of mutual funds - equity, hybrid, small cap, mid cap, mix cap, tax savings etc. Few things I have understood is that (pls feel free to correct me if I am wrong) before you choose to invest in a mutual fund, look at few things, \\n\\n1. The net assets (bigger the number, better it is, basically means a lot of ppl have put money into it, indicates that ppl trust it and is safe risk wise)\\n\\n2. Check how it has performed over a period of yrs - 3 yrs, 5yrs, 10 yrs etc. \\n\\n3. If you are young, suggestion is to invest in equity find more and less in debt/liquid fund. \\n\\n4. Look at the rating (go for 5 star), the companies that each fund invests money in (if you want to know more details) \\n\\n5. Diversify, don't put all your eggs in one basket. \\n\\n6. If you are putting in mutual funds, think of long term and not short term, the returns come to you only in long term. \\n\\n7. If you want a back up, have an equity fund to go with liquid fund (just like a lil savings account with higher interest rate than bank actually, unless the market is a total crap).\\n\\n8. Expense ratio: The lower the better. Its says cannot view community. Yes you can. That's because nifty is already managed ,a fund manager is not needed to manage that much , whenever nifty changes the fund manager changes the same way.\\n\\nOr invest in index/nifty funds that have least expense ratio to maximize your returns. Dont know, what is that,i just got that link. I was writing fast ,with references from somewhere and i copied it. For stocks it is varisity.zerodha.com > The net assets (bigger the number, better it is, basically means a lot of ppl have put money into it, indicates that ppl trust it and is safe risk wise)\\n\\nsize does not relate to risk AT ALL.\\n\\n>Check how it has performed over a period of yrs - 3 yrs, 5yrs, 10 yrs etc. \\n\\nPast performance is not an indicator of future returns.\\n\\n>Look at the rating (go for 5 star), the companies that each fund invests money in (if you want to know more details) \\n\\nThose ratings are often meaningless. How many thought that Yes Bank was stable and reliable? Sorry, Try now spelling mistake are you implying nifty and index funds are the same? ok. Kindly edit if possible Thanks for correcting me on the first one. That's what my uncle told me who is supposed to be pretty good at this. \\n\\nPast performance acts as an indicator (atleast) of how the fund has been performing over a period of time. And goes without saying that it will give the same future returns. It acts as a proxy. \\n\\nSame goes for ratings. It is a proxy. But there i think everyone knows these things. I want to educate people, who don't know these stuffs ,so i wrote like a basic level understandable material. I am saying nifty is a index,sensex is a index.\\n\\nSo funds that tracks index are index funds. Done deleted the link even. > Past performance acts as an indicator (atleast) of how the fund has been performing over a period of time.

Then please be generous enough to educate me. The reason is i dont like that channel too . I asked a question and they removed it. And then i asked why,they are saying don't argue.\\n\\nI hate that channel. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutual-funds/nav/hdfc-index-fund-sensex-plan/MHD020&ved=2ahUKEwilmM7dwdnoAhWVILcAHR-1BDIQFjAAegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw2yZxvss_4J0kTQEqN6iqCx\\n\\nSee watch the end of any mutual fund ad. They are like a d*ck sometimes\\n\\nWas it about shares? If it's a doubt pertaining to your investments, you gotta ask in the stickied biweekly thread. cool I asked about IPO ,like is it a good IPO?

       "  'comments': 'DGCA has nothing to say in this matter inspite of it being the aviation body responsible to handle such matters.\\n\\nMillions of customers have their flights cancelled and how is it that these airlines grab all that money with some vague \"protect your PNR\" carrot. When flights reopen later this year the customers will be forced to over pay prices on top of what they had already paid for. These companies will try to fleece the customers any way they can. Absolutely disgust business practices. If the airlines decline refund to the ticketholders, the ticketholders hence commoners will get screwed.\\n\\nIf they do refund, their revenue will get hit. Flls and Dlls will start block trading at the slightest hint of downturn towards unsustainable level. Its the retail investors who are once again commoners who will get screwed. In case, the company proceeds towards bankruptcy, the majority shareholder will just file it (if not already sold off) and get away with other leverages. The retail investors hence commoners will get screwed even bad.\\n\\nIn case, the govt. order other public companies for bailout, their revenues will get hit hence the retail stockholders of those companies will get screwed. Also those public companies in order to compensate will raise their service charges and other charges. And once again commoners will get screwed.\\n\\nIn case, the govt uses its own fund for bailout, in order to compensate for it they will up the taxes. So once again the commoners will get screwed.\\n\\nSo whatever means is possible to address the issue will result in commoners getting screwed. Capitalism is designed in this way only. We had a big upcoming trip for a family of 5 to Singapore and Malaysia.\\n\\nFor AirBnB (Accommodation), Singapore accommodation got refunded 100% to my bank account. Malaysia accommodation got refunded to AirBnB credits. That\\'s fine because they don\\'t have many restrictions, it\\'s a small amount, and I can use it until the end of 2021.\\n\\nFor flights, Singapore Airlines is processing my refund in full to my source of payment. However, Indigo is tricky. The travel is for May 9 from Malaysia to BLR. However, they are now offering a credit shell with a 50% deduction. Maybe they will later enhance it to 100% to credit shell.\\n\\nI don\\'t have a problem with a credit shell. The issue is, the amount will be split among all the people in the PNR. The same people have to travel. Why do they mandate that? Why can\\'t it be like a normal wallet if you are refusing to refund to the source?\\n\\nI am guessing that airlines are hoping that the same set of people cannot travel and they can guzzle the money. or, upsell costlier tickets later since we have to pay the fare difference. This is absolutely horrible service. We have 4 domestic tickets booked for May end and with this stupid rule where I cannot get refund, I stand to lose 26K. Honestly speaking you have to feel about the aviation industry too .. They all are suffering from serious cash crunch (because of the basic mode of these industries) .. I don\\'t know whether this will come under the ministry regarding to aviation, but if it does come, they should surely come on an agreement with the same I got the complete amount refunded in my Indigo account which I can use later. I think that\\'s fair to both me and the airline. It\\'s already happening. I booked del-blr for 2.5k now I\\'m stuck with credit shell with indigo and spice jet. Both of them are offering del-blr at 3.5k where as air Asia at 2.5k Brother I lost 30k worth (flight tickets + AirBnb) already for the planned travel to Mumbai. At least be happy that you can reschedule it now. You can reschedule your trips. They can have my sympathy, not my money I do not think people understand that there is no need to feel bad for \"companies\". I feel bad for employees not for owners or board or shareholders in these times. Businesses carry business interruption insurance exactly for such scenarios.\\n\\nIf Indigo, spicejet, airindia, etc took this insurance they will be compensated through their claims. If these companies didn\\'t take one, then don\\'t know how to operate.\\n\\nThink of it this way, do any of these companies think when you are in need to cancel the tickets or when you have to travel urgently. They always charge you the market rate, so why does a common person care about how these \"companies\" are doing. A fair thing is to refund the money for services not provided. Not really man. Why does the general public have to care about companies. Go capitalism!! True but when I think about all the employees they have its kind of sad. Nobody should go through layoffs for things beyond their control That\\'s fair i guess. .. you or me are not liable to pay them or help them in any sense what so ever It\\'s not your money once you paid it. Even though the service isn\\'t provided to you, they can reschedule it if it fits their cancellation policy and no explicit laws are broken. I wasn\\'t saying that a normal person should compensate them but Ministry trying something to help them (like restaurants, hotels) so that the whole industry doesn\\'t suffer .. \\nIf a company dies, a whole lot of people (except their customers) suffers be it employees of the same or the whole eco system build around the same company Who do you think the shareholders are?\\n\\nI\\'m going to take a wild guess here and say you have no idea about business. There\\'s just so many inaccuracies with your post I gave up trying to write a reply. General public won\\'t care but the whole ecosystem around the aviation industry will care ...and when in a month or two when the employees will be there on streets, you all will be their saying that government should do the same ..  \\n\\nP.S. i am not saying public should compensate them but the government should help them (but perks which could be reduced taxes, subsidies or something) That is not true. You\\'ve paid for a service, and if the service is not provided to you, you are owed your money back. From my reading of the website of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, a force majeure clause does not apply to refunds due to flights being cancelled less than two weeks of the date of travel -- it says airlines are not required to pay compensation, but you are still very much entitled to a refund. If you are a capitalist, you should have zero sympathy or concern for shareholders (retail or institutional). They take a substantial and willing risk when they buy shares.\\n\\n\\nSo please don\\'t bring the plight of shareholders into this, if you don\\'t want to sound dumb. Companies can\\'t hold us by the throat every single time something goes wrong. I\\'m a capitalist. Not inhuman.\\n\\nAlso, a capitalist has a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders.\\n\\nDo you even know anything?\\n\\nAll these down votes \\\\*facepalm\\\\* READ my comment again .... general public won\\'t care but the government need to care so as to make sure employees won\\'t suffer a lot They shouldnt be able to get access to government support every single time something goes wrong.\\n\\nIf they need government assisstance, they should sell shares to the government.

The gov doesn't care, neither media. All i'll say is ppl start investing in gold and silver, they are ur best bet against inflation. During 2008 crisis, global citizens (remember Chinese investments in treasury) parked their money in USD as a safe haven. I can see the same thing happening once again. UK Pound also at a 35 year low now [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51921922](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51921922) PayPal is still giving 72 conversation rate. Their fees are to high.

Watch GBP, EUR, AUD, SGD et al against the USD.\\n\\nFor example, look at GBP against INR [https://imgur.com/a/QygZ4jN](https://imgur.com/a/QygZ4jN), it's been going down. Sab Changa Si.. Jai Shri Ram Good for me. I am living in India, earning in dollars. Thank you ModiJi. Guess I'll die then. Very refreshing!! Gold is actually down though? [removed] What temporary? Dollar value has been only going up against the Rupee for many many years now.\\n\\nI don't see any major correction even after the Corona virus is tackled. No way !!! \\n\\n\\nHe is not going to retire from his dictatorship There is  shah and  Yogi in queue for PM position to continue the legacy . [removed] wanna bet it could be early than you expect. I mean, a weaker rupee is good for exports and we might have a chance given how badly hit China is.\\n\\nHowever, considering everybody in the govt and their uncle used to scream that the world is coming to an end when rupee slid under the UPA, this govt has no moral ground to stand on, IMO. 1947 That's not true, never was. Nope, During 1947,  £1 ~ $1 = ₹ 13.3\\n\\nSo, we started from 13 now we’re at 75, such improvement. /s Copper seems to be falling Those fuckers need to die. I have now started offering discounts at a loss to me to any client who would shift from Paypal to wire transfer. It's so cheap compared to the money that Paypal loots from you. Achhey din for someone. Yes, because there is deflation in the economy currently and gold is a hedge against inflation. What I'm saying is that there might be a good amount of inflation in the next coming months as governments dole out packages, and if you don't have a hedge against it your money will depreciate.\\n\\nWe live in a socialist country, so ours might be even more hit than usual. And the government has no money, so will have to print more money to get any. Either way, I'm investing a good amount in SGB in next month's cycle. it wasn't doing great even before corona so bashing is fine. Dollar value will go up by 4-5% every year. That's just our inflation - US inflation. However, sharp movements like this are not the part of that cycle.\\n\\nThe rupee will reach 75 per dollar, or even 80 per dollar eventually. But the 75 per dollar should happen next year and the 80 per dollar in mid 2022. Oh he will. A mafia boss doesn't remain a mafia boss forever. His lieutenant will take over one day, sooner rather than later. Yogi ji is next yo. After that Tejasvi Surya will perform swayam seva on the country. The RSS has a strategy to have yogi bear as the prime minister soon.. Most of time value was intentionally diluted to encourage fdi, but rupee should have settled around 50-60, 75 is too much Bruh he was asking about gold ( i may be missing a joke tho) how do you invest in SGBs?I mean what is the method? >We live in a socialist country, so ours might be even more hit than usual.\\n\\nWhy would that be? What sectors would be hit more? When you say more than usual do you mean, more than non-socialist countries, or more than we as people are used to? Cryptocurrency can also be a good diversification If you have a demat, it's pretty easy. Otherwise you can search on RBI site or get it through your bank.\\n\\nHere's the FAQ:\\n\\nhttps://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=109#:~:text=Bonds%20are%20sold%20through%20offices,directly%20or%20through%20their%20agents. Here's what I think will happen. Since we are a poor socialist country, people expect and depend on government to solve their issues. As people have to be quarantined and lose their daily wage, they'll start demanding government to pay them.\\n\\nThe government obviously has no money since as usual, they spend it all in vote bank politics and useless schemes. So when there's an actual need for money, the government is fucked. There are 3 ways to handle this:\\n\\n1. Raise direct taxes: this will screw up the middle class, or the corporate sector. Classic case of kicking someone when they are down. Either way, the demand goes even lower and businesses go bankrupt -> credit crisis getting even worse.\\n\\n2. Raise indirect taxes on things like petrol or GST: This is already being done. However, since people are not buying stuff the government won't be able to collect much. So they'll have to raise it quite a lot on more products. This leads to again demand getting lower and businesses getting bankrupt -> credit crisis getting even worse.\\n\\n3. Print more money: We know how this goes.\\n\\nIn reality, this government played with the economy for 5 years and now economy will play with them. In the last 75 years of governance in our country, we have probably only got like 10 years of good economic support by the government (1990-2000). 👍 \"},\n",

But, I\\'ll like to point out to the big bank UCO Banks as well..As the highest number of NPA\\'s under it\\'s portfolio and account withdrawl of only 50,000 per day already for their accounts.\\n\\nMy dad used to have UCO now made him switch to HDFC. Be wary of IndusInd and Axis. They may go the YES way. ICICI? Why? Is ICICI Bank risky? I think at present situation keeping cash in hand, some gold it much better than keeping money in banks. go check out r/indiainvestments instead of asking here, where people are just giving their baseless opinions. There, it was discussed, and appropriate reasons were also provided. \\n\\nAlso, nothing is going to happen to ICICI, because it\\'s categorised as too big to fail, along with HDFC and SBI. This means they have to follow more stringent rules. I really dont understand these rating agency , when the entire world is in chaos , do we really we some rating agency throwing some bad numbers on everyone , when we all know its bad for entire earth ?\\n\\ncant we just put these agency on hold for say 5 months ?\\n\\nJust asking... Lol Hey I don\\'t understand these terms but can you help me my father\\'s life savings are in IDFC First bank\\nHow is that bank doing? more importantly also look out for RBL bank. They are not reviewed by Moody’s but I’ll be cautious on that too. Unke bhi modi kaka lode lgane wale hain They are also gonna get fucked by mudi kaka It\\'s their job. If the stock markets are operating, then they have to keep operating as well. Even if they are \"put on hold for five months\", it\\'s not like the banks will also be \"put on hold for five months\", risky banks will collapse in the meantime. \\n\\nIndians banks highest share price.was Rs 1400 barely seven months ago, now it is Rs 1200. These banks were facing severe problems even before Corona, now they are under severe pressure. What exactly happened? It was in talks that it is going to be privatised It is private? ICICI is? yeah icici is private.....i was talking about LIC when i mentioned about talks of it being privatised but ICICI is private So, why ICICI then? there is rumours that it would share the same fate as YES bank i suggest you take out your money if you have an account in that bank That\\'s fucking stupid. If ICICI fails, there is no bank in India that will be safe. It\\'s India\\'s second largest bank and a SIFI. It\\'s loan books, while not great are not YES Bank level bad as well. Moody\\'s is either listening to idiots or to WhatsApp forwards for ratings then Don\\'t know man after well how this regime handled economy i am not holding my breath '},\n",

       "  'comments': \"Good relief for the middle class. How will banks be affected by this? Does it include Axis Finance Consumer Durable Loan EMI for OnePlus phones? Before jumping on this news you all need to consider that this is still an advisory and not a rule. Banks won't automatically stop collecting the EMI. They will cut based on their auto debit feature. So reach out to the bank and ask them to uphold the advisory. They still might not allow to defer it but if you default at least your credit score won't be impacted. So. I can stop the auto debit instruction for my education loan, and stop paying credit card bills, and there will be no financial penalty or impact on my credit score. Right? 3 months ?? Is there a possibility of extending the lockdown for next 3 months ? Which EMI? I have an Amazon Pay EMI coming up. I _can_ pay it.. But I'm not sure if I can pay the next one without making some adjustments Will auto deductions from the accounts or do we need to request them not to collect them . We can bash the way lockdown was implemented, troubles faced by the daily wage labourers, but somehow we still seem to be better prepared (case in point the RBI measures, measures announced by FM yesterday) than other countries. I am happy that i am in India right now and not abroad.\\n\\nI hope we come out from this wiser and start ramping up our medical facilities like crazy. Will this apply for the apps that lends money? Don't avail thisb if you can afford it. You will still be accruing interest. If it's a large loan like for a house, then that's going to be a lot Bullshit. Just yesterday HDFC Bank cut 22000 EMI from my account. Repo decreased. FD interest will go down. Pensioners will be under stress Good relief for the banks as they don't have to mark the accounts as NPA which will erode their capital base. For individuals, it's also good as they have more disposable income for the next 3 months. \\n\\nA good step by RBI as far as Individuals are concerned. \\n\\n\\nBut bigger worry is that the MSME advances may never recover when the lockdown is lifted. Government needs to provide some kind of interest subvention. Obviously stock prices will go down, but that's totally understandable in today's economy. \\n\\nTheir liquidity ratio will reduce but that's okay too, as some economic package might be implemented which will help the banks.\\n\\nOverall banks benefit when their customers don't go bankrupt. \\n\\nSo banks by giving a break are ensuring that their customers are well enough now that they can pay it back later. This is an awesome deal for those who have lost their jobs or business owners who will get low or no revenue these months. But if you have a job, please pay off you EMIs on time.\\n\\nThis is not forgiveness of EMIs. The bank will only defer the EMI and increase your loan tenure by more than 3 months. All EMIs. There does not seem to be any specific guideline that only Home/Auto loans will be exempted. First of all RBI has only allowed banks to allow moratorium. The ball is still in your bank's court. \\n\\nAnd secondly, credit card companies aren't banks they are NBFCs.\\n\\nEDIT:NBFCs are also allowed to defer repayment aka moratorium. Yes , this needs to be kept in mind  , people see EMI and jump onto it . Credit card bill is not covered under this moratorium.\\n\\nSource: https://twitter.com/CNBCTV18Live/status/1243417645732356097?s=09 you still have to pay interest , only that its delayed . after three months your emi will continue and your payment will be extended by more than three months if interest remains same If it got controlled then there will be no extension. It's just that people need to keep some least amount of money for daily needs. Please God, no. I may die if they do extend lockdown for 3 months. Not 3 months, but i expect it to get stretched till April end. The corona wont end magically after 21 days of lockdown and the masses should be made aware of this.\\n\\nAlso I feel, we would need atleast 2 weeks of cooling period before things go back to normal. 2 weeks of no cases of corona. No country would be able to handle a second outbreak like this. Just for perspective, Wuhan was locked up for >2 months. And they're getting new cases again. So, we don't really know.\\n\\nJust hope that something like this does not recur ever. Yes. Check with ICICI Bank. As of now it is just a guideline from RBI. [deleted] You need to request your bank and the bank needs to accept. It's the bank's call. Although, banks will be considerate in most cases. Onus likes on you to prove that your income has been affected. Are you upset that it got deducted before this measure was announced ? Credit cards? Emi transactions through cc? You may die if they don't. Dont forget about the vaccine. We are forgetting that we need a cure. Quarantine is just 1st towards fighting this virus. Wuhan was a province. I believe a partial lockdown might be needed but not a complete lockdown. It's just unsustainable in the long term. I have a land loan and a personal loan. So both EMI will not be deducted this 3 months? Thats much better Still have to pay as Credit card payments are not exempted Not completely sure. But I would assume no. Mainly term loans are covered under this. Best to check with your bank. Before vaccine we need to test test test Vaccine is 1-2 years away. Don't think about it. They're Are your credit card payments deferred?

       "  'body': \"I see a lot of misinformation floating around about the RBI moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, I guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  \\n     \\nWhen you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      \\n\\nCredit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.\",\n",

I can pay debts now, no guarantee how the economy will look after 3 months. Is the moratorium automatically applied or do you need to choose it somewhere. Because I don't need a moratorium This its another master stroke by RBI to pull in funds if you have crossed the half way mark in your loan tern - then delaying the 3 months of EMI is a good thing. \\n\\nhowever, if you are in the first half of your loan term - it's not really worth the effort. What if you use the moratorium to keep some cash and once the situation improves pay it back as a bulk amount. So basically hold on to the cash now and pay it off in a few months.\\n\\nThe interest difference won't be too bad then right? [deleted] This is the only smart thing to do. If the economy remains the same in 6 months many might well need to take on loans then. If the options before a bank are you and a person who has availed a moratorium, guess who the bank would prefer lending to with a better rate. Moratoriums may not be reported to credit bureaus but people would be kidding themselves if they think banks won't keep or ask for records. Same bro. And accumulating some emergency fund. Nah it is opt in In that case, simply pay your dues on time. Doesn't loan deference work the same way though? At most this is a loan deference worded just a bit new. You'd *lose* less in interest if your remaining term is small but there is still nothing to gain, though. If you can find a place that gives you garentee returns over the interest rate which is impossible because Government Bonds are trading around 4-6% for 3 months and there is no loan that would be at that rate. Yeah. There will just be some prepayment charges It can be, I got SMS and Email from two of my credit card banks about this. Reduce debt as much as possible. Debt+economic crisis is one way street to endless economic hardship for individuals. Moratorium is useful for people who have lost jobs or businesses that have gone offline, but there's no relaxation on the interest. Any salaried individual who's getting paid and yet taking the moratorium isn't understanding the long term impact. The banks will not let go, the government won't bail out the middleclass, we're on our own. It may vary from bank to bank. For example for ICICI, certain loans like home, car etc are opt out, but commercial loans are opt in by default. The EMI is usually auto debited Yes but the problem is how this was advertised in the media, especially before yesterday when many banks came out with their terms. It suggested that the moratorium is a relief measure intended for everyone. One gentleman from SBI even said yesterday on the news that he expected close to 100% of people to opt-in. > u'd lose less in interest if your remaining term is small but there \\n\\nthe logic is that if my loan is at say 8% and i have 3 years to go for the loan to finish, if i invest the 3 emi's in a full equity mutual fund then i'd hopefully have got a lot more than 8% return over the next 3 years. I can confirm, its available for credit cards as well. You dont need to apply for moratorium like loans. You may just simply choose not to pay. >  For example for ICICI, certain loans like home, car etc are opt out,\\n\\nwhat do you mean by opt out? If I am having home loan from ICICI then my next EMI won't cut for next 3 months even if there is enough fund in my account? I guess you can go for it if you are an experienced invester but note that your gains have to be above ~9% to break even. For ICICI home loans, they will deduct the EMI unless you tell them you don't want to. Doesn't matter if you have money in your account or not. \"},\n",

       "  'comments': \"Actually, corona virus is a great excuse for bjp to blame all their economical problems on. Now, for the next few years any question on economy will be diverged to blame corona virus. Like, how they blame 70 years of congress for most of Indias problems. Well written thoughts. \\n\\nThis Corona Virus outbreak is a Godsend for this government to bury all their misgovernance and failures in economic policies in deep. \\n\\nWhen we recover from this virus, still they can continue to blame on the Virus until next General Election announced, and during that time the Islamic Monster will suddenly appear from BJP closets. This Like it matters now, the timing for this virus could not have been better for BJP Finally! An article that counts international community's misadventures for ailing economy. Demonetisation has undeniably had bad effect on the nation but so did US-China trade war and many other factors. Take my upvote Look it's easy to blame and extremely difficult to solve. Let's hope atleast for this scene both sides can sort out their differences and work towards a solution. I don't think we have time over politics right now. Not just Bjp, governments world over have found a nice excuse. exactly the point I was gonna raise. Look I want to be as apolitical as possible because the economy is apolitical. Policy isn't. It's not so easy to put a blame on one party or ideology.\\n\\nAny economist having the curse of Casandra realised that something bad was going to happen regardless of these things being effective or not. All I'm trying to prove is that the virus is more like the straw that broke the camels back rather than the reason the economy collapsed. Also a strong and flexible informal sector has saved countless from starvation and kept local markets afloat.\\n\\nThe monsters will appear from the closets of businesses that were not 100% honest. Look these scenarios it doesn't matter what politics is followed right now if the economy isn't actually understood, our politics could change to something completely unprecedented. History often suggests that if economic disasters aren't managed properly it can lead to the rise of actual tyrants. There wouldn't be a BJP or congress if this goes out of hand. lmao... why is Vietnam's economy booming like never before, then? (pre covid19, of course) >Look it's easy to blame and extremely difficult to solve. Let's hope atleast for this scene both sides can sort out their differences and work towards a solution. I don't think we have time over politics right now.\\n\\nSorry, mate. That shit doesn't work when one side wants the other dead. We don’t have time for politics but they have!! Fully agree with you. I am bit worried as our economy is on a downward slope faster which is not easy to stop, and we don’t have the luxury of really qualified people in charge. That’s my worry, and this is going to be the darkest days in Modern history of India. Not to forget Bangladesh! They are holding well! If they don't work together they both will be dead literally and politically. Agree. Centre has not offered any responsible Finance Minister since 2014 and is getting worse. Moreover Modi who had previously suggested previous PM about economic policies required for India has been more talk and less action. u/UserameChecksOut Show any one line which states that Indian economy has been doing well under Modi. Could folks read well before commenting.\\n\\nFor respective countries' growth we should look at their economic reforms and push for private investments which, when compared to India's figures, are big boon for locals.\\n\\nDon't think India can get anywhere from here if land acquisition, complications regarding private employment (states prioritising private jobs for locals) and resolution for completion of infra projects is not taken seriously. Literally? Sure. I don't think right wing politics in India are dying anytime soon. The left is already dead. yes yes.ideals.yes.yes. ?? All we can do now is to pray all this gets over \"},\n",

But he can move his stomach anticlockwise Tax is foreign concept. No one pay tax in Virat Rashtra, neither pay salary That’s a mouthful. > Glad they fined his company\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean Ramdev is going to pay even a \"footi kaudi\" in the fine. Why would you be disappointed with the latter? Unfortunately yes, just heard that. He also added \"Ramdev Baba feeds many people at their headquarters\" Padmashree should be awarded for this /s What time is this? The concept of tax in india is as old as the influx of nomadic Aryans in Gangetic plains.Initially it was voluntary in nature. I perceive it as overregulation of the market How are you.. laughs at Arthashastra by Kautilya Read the article. It is not overregulation by any means. Without it these companies would operate without anyone to answer to except profits. The \"art hash astra\"  deciphering hash or hasta must definitely might have been some technique with hasta( hand) I suppose. I accept the proposal by the corny kautilya chick. > Without it these companies would operate without anyone to answer to except profits.\\n\\nNothing wrong with that. Unless the company is modelled as a non profit organization,why must they answer to anything except profits or shareholders? u/codingCoderCoder We aren\\'t in such an ideal country or society. \\n\\nIf all consumers are educated with perfect rational decision making skills then a completely free market is best for all.\\n\\nBut when corporations have the option to push mass media coverage of their inferior products touted as being magic cure alls, and when they ruthlessly extend their tentacles to exploit their customers in their chase for profits. That\\'s when they need to be regulated. Not regulated into the ground, but regulated enough that they don\\'t harm their own customers, the environment or the country. I agree with you with a caveat that regulators need to be rational. In India regulators are not rational (see AYUSH ministry, see cow urine as a cure for many diseases). In this situation, overregulation means customers who are rational cannot bypass the \"rational\" regulations imposed by the regulators\\n\\nSelective enforcement of regulations is also something to consider. See how MRP regulations are enforced on the organized sector but not enforced at train stations or at inter city bus stops Not passing on GST benefits is not flaunting regulations ? Regulating that companies have to pass on GST benefits to their customers is over regulation ? In my view it is overregulation. Why shouldn\\'t  the GST reduction go to employees or to the company\\'s profit margin. No different than how some companies may reduce profit margins and some may hike prices in case of a GST hike Why so much support to pad Patanjali\\'s bank account.\\n\\nConsumers aren\\'t smart enough to vote with their wallets. Give the relief to them.\\n\\nGST is borne by the customer. Any cuts in that should be passed on to the consumer. '},\n",

In TCS your project allocation everything will be based on your luck. Join anything except for TCS. I am assuming you would switch after some experience.\\nThere’s a policy where once you quit TCS, you cannot join again.\\nMaking a few switches would let you get the compensation jumps and when you join TCS after a few years, you can lap up a great package plus you can also plan your retirement there! Also worth noting is the yearly hike at TCS stands at an average of 6.5% of current CTC. I work in Capgemini. My honest opinion - join none of them. They will ruin your career. You have lot of options as cs graduate. Which college allowed you to block 4 jobs? The placement officer need to be sacked.\\n\\nMany of the companies are cancelling offer letter due to corona pandemic. Are you trying to show off?  Becoz proud and pride is the beginning stage of downfall Agree. Look at the work culture - if you can get in touch with seniors from your college or ppl whom you know through relative ke relative ka relative. \\n\\nSecond, look at the Benefits they are offering. Everyone focuses on money but never consider the benefits - which is important too.\\n\\nEdit: I can help with benefits comparison, if you need. I have a fair bit of idea on thst front. 6.5%? I've heard it's around 3% You mean higher studies? College only allowed me one, I got the rest from off campus sir Wait why does the placement officer need to be fired? Isn't it a good thing if the student has more options? Your second part of comment is actually very helpful which no one else has pointed out. But the first part is as much shitty as the second part is helpful. Too much for assuming things. Someone who is mature enough might not call it as a show off. It is a trivial thing honestly. OP got 4 offers. Probably like 4 lpa. He asks a very valid question though.\\nTime to take that mind out of your butthole. It’s going to be really difficult for a fresher, but attempt to get an insight into the kind of project they’ll put you in. A lot of companies put freshers into fields they may not be interested in working on & things that they may not even like. It’s difficult, but worth a shot. Speak to the recruiter perhaps? Not like Capgemini atleast 🤣 No mean product companies or startups where learning curve is a lot more. In the companies you mentioned are IT service based companies where management is shit, you will be given project or technology based on your luck not talent, you and some other guy from much lower designation will be treated same even though you know more. So that's why think about it. Do not reject anyone, few of them are cancelling/postponing joining Usually in a college, once you lap up an offer, you cannot sit for any other company unless a percentage (my college had 80%) of total final year students are placed. I agree. When I was referring to work culture - I was trying to get a gauge of how does the orgn treat people, how are the managers, how is the training programs, opportunities to go for international exposure etc. \\n\\nWhen talking about work, I am with you, they throw in random technologies. I ended up getting trained on Android and worked on Java. 🙄 Why? What's the deal with Capgemini? I second this thought OP A couple of years ago, associates there got 0.5% to 1.5% increments. Made quite a news actually \"},\n",

It can go as low as it wants but strong shares like reliance(currently at rs.1068) will rebound back to rs. 12-1300 levels slowly post crisis which is still a huge gain if you buy right now and can afford to hold for a long duration. Right time to buy and perfect time to buy are different concepts and almost nobody except insiders can accurately predict the lowest price.

Idk about that but I remember paying Rs 700 for 6GB, 3G data plan on Aircel in 2016. I dont think it\\'ll ever go back to that now.\\nedited: spelling That would\\'ve meant almost a decade of low price in the middle right? It has already happened. They have pulled the long term plans that I used to subscribe. Instead, they are forcing users to opt for their 1 gb, 2gb per day stupid plans. No one will learn anything. They will just suck up and pay for it. Sorry I didn\\'t get you. Can you please explain? What anti-competitive practices? Internet rates are supposed to be really cheap. Predatory pricing in this case is the ideal pricing. Airtel too had almost the same tariffs as Jio soon after they launched. Were they running on losses then ? https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/govt-looking-into-flipkart-amazon-discounts-after-retailer-complaints-11571137317402.html Yup obviously. That\\'s the way it works with technology, would you expect a mid end laptop at 50k now? Jio did not revolutionize anything they just used their connections with the govt to run a scam and everybody flocked to them for free shit. The prices will never reach that high, like 250 for 1GB. The tech and the dependant economy has come to far for that. What I\\'m thinking is like 30GB of data for about 500 per month and flattening out.\\n\\nAlso not a decade. The prices are on for rise again, if trai intervenes we can reach the limit by next year. Read the article... Jio did a lot of damage with the entire free trial duration. That\\'s predatory. Saying hi from \\'Canada\\'. Looking at India telco prices is the most upsetting thing ever. You don\\'t even know what high telecom costs even look like. \\n\\nThe market did indeed need correction. Similar thing happened when Rs 500 Reliance had launched with unlimited Reliance to Reliance calls, no roaming etc. So the other companies which were looting us at 250 per Gb for many years face no repercussions ?\\n\\n1 gb per day for 24 days is 248 on Jio and 219 on Airtel for 28 days.\\n\\nAirtel has the lower pricing now. \\n\\nNone of this makes sense. Agreed. That was for 6 months was it ? Literally everyone I knew was on it. But most of my friends switched to Airtel as soon as the tariffs almost matched up. And I\\'d gladly state under oath that Airtel coverage is much better than Jio\\'s. I stay in UK and yes prices here are much more than what they\\'re in India. But the quality of service is so much better and the prices are generally relative to the purchasing power of an area. \\n\\n\\n\\nMarket usually corrects itself like it did everywhere else in the world. In India that correction was brought forward 6-12 months and sent the telecom sector reeling and forced closure of many up and coming telcos. When infrastructure is rare, demand is low and technology is new, prices are expensive. Once it becomes common so that the infrastructure can be developed and invested in, the price starts going down. It\\'s deflation, works in almost the entirety of tech industry and many other industries. Good for your friends, but it probably doesn\\'t reflect what the rest of the nation did. Yes UK and EU in general are amazing when it comes to telecommunication services both quality and pricing.  NA is just different and terrible with Canada being the worst among developed nations for data pricing. And in my initial post I was speaking with regard to purchasing power itself. Direct forex conversion obviously doesn\\'t make sense. \\n\\nAlso, out of curiosity which up and coming telcos are you talking about? As per my observation India is a very price sensitive market with absolutely zero consideration given to quality, loyalty and let alone sustainability. So who has the advantage in the market now ? \\n\\nSeems Airtel offers much better value than Jio. Idea had to merge. Aircel went bankrupt, no idea what happened to Docomo. His brother\\'s reliance communication went bankrupt as well. You\\'re right about it being a price sensitive market but people are lazy too, so they won\\'t switch to save 50 rupees but they sure as hell would if it was free. Loyalty is in abundance in India right now - if you align yourself with the right people - and will be here till we have this ideological war going on. \\n\\n\\nHaving said all that, Jio is not safe as Voda is really pushing to enter rural markets and trying out various tie-up with other content providers, so is Airtel. Also, Jio is so shit, like it\\'s not even 2G sometimes so people won\\'t be patient forever. Jio has the numbers because it provided free service so people took subscription, obviously. This took all new and freebie lover customers over to Jio, instead of Airtel or voda. Then they kept hiking the price slowly so that no one feels like they\\'re being exploited.\\n\\n\\n\\nJio has a massive advantage now. Voda and Airtel might as well collapse in the coming years because of all the loses they\\'re incurring. Agreed. I might sound unfair and mean but nothing in the world can make me as happy as seeing Ambanis fail (its an exaggeration). But i just can\\'t stand the sight of that family. Great businessmen but not a leader, not a person who can lead by example, not the people who would like to see India grow as much their business. Like Ambani\\'s don\\'t reflect the values of a Tata or a Premji. The biggest advantage Jio has is its seen by bhakts as a nationalist telco. /s Yeah this is what I keep seeing as well. \\n\\nBut are people solely using Jio these days ? Most people have two sims and the other is free for Airtel or such. Granted people don\\'t pay for both sims.\\n\\nAre there some numbers as to how screwed Airtel and Vodafone are ? Because in my experience Jio has the worst coverage and speeds of all three. They reported losses of about 70k+ crores, so they\\'re very screwed. You can have 2 sims but now you need to pay a monthly charge for both of them which is not happening at all, as you said. People stick to Jio because loyalty and our govt likes Jio I guess. Smart people have moved away from Jio, need to give everyone some time before they come to their senses and realise the shitty service they\\'re getting. Most people with jio used to have a free airtel/idea sim. But since airtel/idea mandated a monthly minimum recharge of 35 rs (which is now 49 rupees), some people have stopped using them. Oh yeah. They block incoming calls too if you don\\'t pay up the 35 a month. \\n\\nIt\\'s really hard to feel sorry for them. '},\n",

How much did the country\\'s total workforce decline by, as a baseline(in case that 10% dip is in absolute numbers of women employed and not women as a fraction of the workforce)?\\n2. Could there have been other macroeconomic changes around the same time that disproportionately impacted industries employing lots of women?\\n\\n/EDIT\\n\\nThey cite a survey by localcircles but the actual data is nowhere to be found; the best I could get is [this article](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/startups/small-cos-hire-fewer-women-to-save-maternity-costs/74541809) reporting on the survey, which says\\n\\n>Nearly half of early stage startups and small businesses in a survey said they have hired fewer or no women in the last 12 months, citing the higher cost of complying with the government’s six-month paid maternity leave policy.\\n\\nNow that would be pretty definitive, however I am not confident that the survey was structured so as to allow respondents to \\'cite a reason\\' for increased or decreased hiring of women\\n\\n>It, however, showed that about 44% of respondents wanted the current policy to stay.\\n\\nAnyway the original article seems to be reporting on a survey which seems to not be public. Neither the design, nor the raw responses, leave alone methodology(how were respondents selected, how many did not respond etc.). That\\'s why menstrual leave for women would not be helpful it will only increase discrimination and give another excuse for corporations to not take them for jobs. Add a peternity leave and problem solved. Ah yes. But even when we are single employers have questions like “You’re Muslim, so why haven’t your parents gotten you married yet? How are they letting you work???” \\n\\nSo who is the ideal woman in the eyes of these companies? Who is the most employable? If you ever worked in a startup, you know how much is the work pressure, usually, women hardly prefer to join. They join marketing or product management. Another thing, why force a cash crunch company to pay for maternity? Equality doesn\\'t work if you shove everything in our throats. If the startup succeeds, it can create many jobs. \\n\\nWomen leave the workforce because of family commitment, they do that in western countries too. You just can\\'t keep your family happy and have a successful professional life. It\\'s easy to blame the employer and say how sexist they are when it comes to hiring. But think about it - a bootstrapped startup that has a hand to mouth existence cannot simply afford paying salaries to its employees when they are not working - that too, for six months at a stretch. \\n\\nThe government cannot wash its hands off by simply announcing six months maternity for women. They should also bear the cost; at least partly for the women who do avail the break. If you want companies to hire despite potentially losing an employee for an extended period, at least provide them with incentives that will soften the blow. people in India think having one negligent parent, and one attentive parent is a good thing for a child.\\n\\nMy mother had to prove to her bosses that she could function with a womb. My dad didn’t. Guess which parent spent more time with me when I was growing up. and which one was promoted more. I know this sounds sexist but rarely have I enjoyed working with women. There\\'s just so much drama and stress over petty issues. Although this is just my experience and it can vary amongst different fields.\\n\\nWith regards to startups, they simply cannot afford paying maternity leave unless the government compensates for it (by reducing taxes or something). k If that happens, you\\'d just see a lot more \"contractors\" than employees. Better solution is to have the government pay the salary for the 6 month maternity leave. Forcing the private sector to pick up the burden would obviously lead to gender discrimination. It\\'s an added burden on the startups, although it does bring down the incentives to not hire women. But again, the reasons startups don\\'t hire women goes beyond just the maternity break. Women quit jobs after getting married, or quit after childbirth to become SAHMs. The probability of this happening with the guy is far less. \\n\\nCompanies need to have tax incentives when they hire women. Or, government should offer more tax breaks to married women. Yes, there is going to be someone who is going to call this sexist because why should women get married to enjoy tax incentives. Or, why can\\'t they have children outside of marriage? But the point is to provide incentives to the 99% of the women who quit after getting married or after childbirth to continue with their career. It’s just not the maternity leave. A lot of startups expect you to work long hours, 16 hour days. You just can’t hire a 28 year old married girl for this. Not because she is not good, but it will be extremely difficult for her. And no one wants unhappy employees. Exactly! My friend\\'s company in UK allows shared leaves, so the husband is taking 6 months to care for the baby. Its amazing! When more people do this, the discrimination would go away because it won\\'t be gender specific. Totally unrelated to the post but the quote above applies to both genders when it comes to Muslims. Sometimes people(employers) have zero boundry If you have two X chromosomes in India, you are either batshit crazy, thus single, or married. All this just boils down to the fact that men usually have zero responsibilities towards child birth, taking Care of a baby , domestic chores etc... Its usually the women who bears the brunt of it as our society collectively thinks its only the women\\'s responsibility. I have joined the work force after 45 day maternity break and could do that only due to my supportive mother staying with me, its difficult but not impossible. So what do you suggest women do? Work during labour also? What about the baby? Are you ready to see/hear/smell a wailing baby,diaper changes in the office environment? \\nWomen don\\'t leave the workforce until and unless there is no maternal policy in place. And in middle and lower income families women sometimes is essential. Leaving the job adds additional stress on the family and the earning members of the family. Don\\'t spoil the fun with truth! >Although this is just my experience and it can vary amongst different fields.\\n\\nWhich field do you work in?\\n\\nI\\'ve worked with many women over the years and I\\'ve not had any problems that were gender specific. I encountered shitty people and honestly most of them were male because men dominated the companies I\\'ve worked with.\\n\\nMaybe you look at women\\'s reaction in a prejudiced way and rationalise a man\\'s poor behaviour? If a man is rude you think of him as an \"asshole\" at an individual level, but if a woman behaves like that you attribute it to \"women do drama\" and \"she must be pms-ing\"? o >Forcing the private sector to pick up the burden would obviously lead to gender discrimination.\\n\\n\\nNot when paternity is available as well and is being utilised. Either gender can take the paid 6 months off. My male friend is doing it in the UK.\\n\\n> Forcing the private sector to pick up the burden\\n\\nGiving weekends off are also a burden. Holidays are a burden. But we find a way around it. European companies have managed to make it work. Well I’ve been the only Muslim in most of the startups I’ve worked with/at (in South India), so I guess that explains why I was treated like a zoo animal a lot. That\\'s another thing, then women need to find the right person, like how men try to do. There is no reason an employer needs to take the responsibility to pay the female colleagues. The cost is eventually divided among everyone in the office, why male colleagues need to take responsibility of a baby which is not theirs ? True. As women are earning members of families, and have been for as long as domestic work has existed, I believe we as a society can do much better. 9 months of paid leave doesn’t go down too well with startups with little funding. Something something why should someone pay if you decided to get creampied no one asked for it other guy at startup had put his entire life and finances at stake and /s This I hate when people say something that works everywhere else is not gonna work here, yep I know  corruption is high but that should not not stop us from taking these steps, also most people don\\'t wanna be employed as contractors. > European companies have managed to make it work.\\n\\nAny guess who pays for it? It works because the money comes from their country\\'s social welfare fund. The private sector is NOT picking up the burden. You don\\'t have to take my word for it, I\\'ll just leave this link [here](https://shieldgeo.com/maternity-leave-around-the-world-a-guide-for-international-employers/) if you\\'re interested in learning about it.\\n\\n> Giving weekends off are also a burden. Holidays are a burden. \\n\\nThis is just ridiculous. Try the only one through school (class), only two in college and only one in a team of 16. I\\'m not complaining (far from it) but there comes a time when the good natured stereotypes get face palm-y For women its just another level of discrimination they have to face and the reality of life. We may never reach the level of European countries in offering paternity/maternity benefits , but atleast as a society this collective mentality of people  shoving everything down a women\\'s neck has to stop.  If the laws are in place for mandatory maternity/paternity leaves then I guess the cost of that gets equally shared .\\n\\nSome of the posts here sound like women decided by themselves alone to get pregnant all the men working in startups are never going to be fathers.\\n\\nInfact some or most of the startups are not even providing a basic medical insurance  facility to the employees, so maternity costs are something very far away to be expected to be paid. I mean, most women these days are gaslighted into a marriage and being forced to have kids because \"log kya kahenge\" mentality. They don\\'t have much of a choice , especially if the husband is a horny dummas who can\\'t use a condom It works everywhere else because public funds pays for the employee\\'s salary. The company isn\\'t affected. If India adopts that method, it\\'ll work here. As it stands, the current policy just leads to gender discrimination. Is it really a surprise that companies want to reduce their risk? >Any guess who pays for it? \\n\\nIn UK it\\'s the company. Govt only assists with £150 a week.\\n\\n>This is just ridiculous.\\n\\nNo it isn\\'t if you think with an open mind. Work week in India used to be 6 days till Rajiv changed it. That loss of 1 day is also a cost (52 days a year). Ideally companies would want to make you work 7 days a week if they could. Or give you very few holidays, like in the US, as opposed to Europe. I’m sorry you had to go through that. I didn’t even recognize them as stereotypes until much later. I just thought they were good-natured ignorant questions. We are not that wealthy. European countries started to provide recently when birth rate became too low.\\n\\nI guess, women get pregnant for their husbands and family. If the husbands and the family can\\'t support, it\\'s their mistake. There is no reason to shove on everyone\\'s throat. I\\'ve gotten used to it, especially when it\\'s my friends, I know they are just pulling my leg but when someone not inside my friends circle like an employer or a colleague uses them, really makes you wonder how much they judge you beyond the image what you\\'ve created.\\n\\nOf course, this applies to a small population who have no idea what is and isn\\'t a proper conversation topic Well, I especially think that friends should not behave that way. I\\'ve had several friends like this over the years: somebody whose mom called me over for lunch and said Muslims did 2002, then somebody else who earnestly asked me to confide in her if I was really from Pakistan, and another friend whose parents were glad that I wasn\\'t a hijabi because they\\'re \"a different kind of Muslim.\" I guess I learned down the line that these conversations just dehumanized me, and these people didn\\'t add value to my life. And all of these people were from educated, \"liberal and secular\" families.\\n\\nBut of course, it\\'s hard when an employer or a colleague does it. There is a power imbalance in a professional setting. You cannot leave the company if you need the money, and you don\\'t want to come across as confrontational either.\\n\\nI wish for all of us to have the agency, courage and presence of mind to speak up during these times because it\\'s definitely not something I want to continue getting used to. None of us should. That\\'s fucked up but with my friends it\\'s usually the \"biriyani\" joke or a kind of shocked expression if I don\\'t order meat when I\\'m out with them. I know them pretty well enough to know they aren\\'t being insulting/racist (? Is that the right word)\\n\\nLike I said, most people don\\'t realise how their words comes across to the other person. I find it better to shrug it off since it\\'s not like I need them to tell what I am and aren\\'t. It\\'s easier to ignore the ignorant. I don’t know if it’s racist, but it’s definitely language that “others”.\\n\\nI get what you mean, I just find it hard to give people the benefit of doubt anymore. '},\n",

I'm in no way saying that you can't have a career in IB without MBA but that's what the majority does.\\n\\nIf you can't get into top banks right now, what you can do is go to boutique firms and work there for 3-4 years, then go for a M7 MBA, or any equivalent European one and then move to a top bank post MBA.\\n\\nOther course of action would be going the consulting route and then get an MBA, then IB.\\n\\nIf you ask me, I'd say the hell away from IB unless your sole goal is to earn money and WLB is not that big of a deal. Its a highly lucrative and prestigious job, no doubt but you'd be spending the best years of your life 20-30s/35s in office and your pay would be only marginally better than many who work for far less hours in other areas. \\n\\nI am in no way discouraging you, its just that many people don't know about this part and imagine all the sports cars, yachts and mansions and what not. But in reality only a few get to that place and boy it takes a long time and lot of hit on personal relationships.\\n\\nBest of luck, and remember networking is the key. You have to make a lot of cold calls to land an interview. Always be on the lookout and try to get in touch with people who're already at the firms, or those who recruit people in those firms, LinkedIn is your best friend. Upvoted for visibility. So I should get an MBA from these universities? I'm aware of the WLB. Right now (before the pandemic), I attend classes, on-campus club meetings, and work part-time around 50 hours a week. This is without counting my own study time. I'm an introvert with 0 social life. I realize that I'm only 20 and my priorities might change dramatically in the future but I guess, for now, a banking career is the only option that's appealing to me. I'm looking into ER as well which has a slightly better WLB than IB. Thank you for all the advice! That won't guarantee an IB placement. Though it is a prerequisite for getting a front end IB job (general trend, please don't @me with exceptions). Hiring for IB mainly happens from\\n1. Campus - 70%\\n2. Lateral hires with workex in other IB firms (yeah like making curd) - 20%\\n3. Lateral hires with workex in equity research - 10%\\n\\nSo your options are getting grad workex + CFA, earn, do an MBA, continue IB search outside and in India... Or join an ivy League MBA college in India + CFA, get campus placement or get equity research placement and keep trying subsequently. Yes. Or go to ivy league colleges in US/UK/singapore. Thank you so much! It gave me a lot of insight. Is it okay to network with bankers in India? Each country has different norms and I'm not sure what's appropriate in India in terms of job search. And I wouldn't ask them for a job. Just want to build a network and learn more about how it works here Is there any way to do it right after undergrad? I have a good corporate finance internship this summer. I've been networking with people in the US and Singapore hoping to get a full time position. Does networking usually work in India as well? It is perfectly fine to network with bankers. Use LinkedIn liberally. And pls do NOT be shy in asking for a job - just don't open with that during the cold contact stage. In India almost everyone who reaches out on LI is either looking for funding or looking for a job or research inputs. Everyone wants something - be upfront abt whatever it is you want. And be prepared for rejection. Atb. Speak to IB professionals in LinkedIn. They can give me better info. I am not in finance domain. Atb. \"},\n",

       "  'comments': 'Jeez man it has already touched 200. Yesterday it was 167. Testing rates are extremely low in India. One day after US started their testing, positive cases went up humongously Sticky post hai bhai updates ke liye Why TOI? I never trust TOI for any news article. Isn\\'t India doing pretty good compared to other countries ? \\n\\nNo. of affected people and deaths is quite low As per the https://www.covid19india.org/ cases has reached 212 with 5 deaths. And as per https://covidout.in/ cases has reached 198 with 4 deaths.. don\\'t know which one I should trust. There are thousands of people roaming around with corona its just that they have not been tested. There\\'s thousands of untested cases going around as we speak We are on track for 1000 cases by the first week of April if the day to day compound growth stays the same (measuring from when we crossed 30 cases and when we crossed 100 cases).\\n\\nP.S. Our daily growth rate is currently around 13-15% in terms of reported cases. Other countries report ~15-25%. So either we are doing better or this is a symptom of our low rates of testing. They\\'ve doubled the number of confirmed cases in 2 days! I was concerned about the same so had been looking for testing data for the pst few days. You will be pleased to know that out of all the people that were tested only 1.37% were positive. I don’t know about other countries but it is lower than every state in US. There may be a lot of asymptotic people in the wild but lower number of cases is certainly not due to lack of testing. We are simply behind by a few days.\\n\\nYou can find the testing data on icmr website. They have a daily update. 13265 people tested so far of which 182 were positive. This as per the most recent daily update. People have been tested and found positive after that but we still don’t have complete data. Also we have performed a little more than half as many tests as US with a far smaller positive cases (edit: as of latest data US has tested a lot more people, 100k+, but their positive rate is above 10%). US seems to be worst prepared of all nations including, in this case, India. I agree with you test rate extremely low in India. Karma sarvopari They couldn\\'t find a cow to milk that\\'s why 3.6 roentgen. Not great, not terrible Testing rates are extremely low\\n\\nBecause if it was really just 195 cases, you wouldn\\'t shut down the economy like this That\\'s because the government is doing next to no testing. It\\'s the equivalent of closing your eyes, covering your ears and saying everything is fine. Pray for India, itlay and all countries. Bless humans This is how it started everywhere, cases are quite low and suddenly it becomes unstoppable. We need to be extra careful and learn from other\\'s mistakes and should not make the same mistakes The higher number. But is much higher in reality. And the more they interact with pl the bigger the number I agree with you. I extrapolated the data till 16/03/2020 by fitting a curve in LibreOffice Calc. Got the same result.\\n\\nWe cross 1000 by 03/04/2020. Key point being \"reported\". Actual infections are currently unknown Chernobyl 2.0 How bad is it ? Contain the spread of misinformation. Wow that is a real great explanation. Even in Chernobyl they tested less and that found less rads. no point testing random people when we don\\'t have many tests. shutting down the economy is the government being proactive. The government is doing better than most other countries but I think they should do better or this won\\'t be contained. Hate to be the rain cloud here but praying does fuck-all. Take recommended precautions and stay safe. If we don’t test, it won’t be unstoppable. Big brain I agree, that\\'s why I mentioned it in my postscript. \\n\\nHowever, I don\\'t have any guesstimate even to tell me how many cases we didn\\'t test or how many slipped through before testing started. So I am not counting those. Either way, the most conservative estimates predict ~1000 cases by April 4th or so (yesterday that threshold jumped to 1st April in my calculations cos the number of cases at the end of the day went up from those reported in the afternoon - I think 186 vs 169 that was reported on earlier).\\n\\nAs we keep getting more an more data, we will get a better picture, if the rate of daily growth spikes hard at some point due to the change in norms for who qualifies to be tested, we will know that the previous reports were all underestimates. They\\'re testing only those who have traveled abroad or those who have been in contact with one\\'s traveled abroad. \\n\\nPeople showing symptoms but not matching the criteria are not being tested. India has a capacity of ministering around 4900 cases per day. They are barely doing a thousand though. Point noted, Bendydick Cucumberbach '},\n",

       "  'comments': \"What about gold? My parents were going to sell a house and invest in mutual funds/FDs; now they want to buy another house by liquidating assets in banks! someone enlighten me please, what does this mean ? Both SIP and FD are bad? Indians will move to a STABLE crypto currency backed by electricity. Sip in mutual funds is better, at least is fund is distributed. Excepting more bank on line due to policies and loop holes Is any bank safe for FD now? Liquidity. \\nRisk, return and liquidity go hand in hand. Real estate is another bubble waiting to burst. Since banks are failing, they both are burying their money. I would like to know as well. My understanding - keep money buried in own backyard. No bank is safe. Inflation loss is smaller that what we saw with yes bank, dhfl, pnc etc Crypto currency is not at all stable. Infact it triggers most big banks and may result in closing of your account in most countries around the globe.\\n\\n\\nAnd most people are defrauded because of crypto has they know very little about it and want to investm HdFC? Can you tell me more I'm 24 and young in my careers so I'm going to buy 4 gold biscuits from all the savings is it a gourd choice? \\n\\nI didn't understand when you said Risk,  return and liquidity goes hand in hand! Yeah, but real estate is at least not going to disappear like your savings in the banks. Worst case, value of your property depreciates, but at least you will have a hunk of land where you can cry yourself to sleep after your life's earnings gets diverted to  cover the fraud committed by rich industrialists. Yeah i have been hearing this since last 20 years; never happens. Atleast in metro city like Mumbai where prices are sky high!\\nThe worst will be that the prices/rent will get stagnated for few years, still better than losing money by investing in banks. What does this really mean? I mean what exactly will happen in order for the real estate burst to happen and how will things be after that? Oh gotcha thanks BTC, USDC, USDT, XRP, TRX are relatively stable currencies. Risk return and liquidity are  very important concepts in the market. Every investor has to invest by looking at these three factors and decide his appetite. It’s very simple. Look at this example\\n\\nArranged marriage - Low Risk, Moderate Return, No liquidity \\nLove marriage - High risk, High Return, Moderate liquidity \\nTinder - High Risk,  High return, High liquidity. You can’t exchange gold for money easily is what I meant.  If you’re looking to not touch your investments for a long time, you can buy it. Also why not purchase it in a commodity markets itself,  that way you get to diversify. Get two biscuits and the balance you buy mutual funds with. Bhai 4 biscuits se kuch nahi hoga liquidity problem. Agar 1-2 kilo loge to bechoge kaha. Haha I thought people invest to generate wealth Wait till water crisis hits. Real estate valuations are jacked up but no one is really buying if they are it’s under the pretext of future higher rent return and capital gain. It’s basically a gamble. In my recent chat with Shankar Sharma, this is exactly what he pointed out. People invest based on past trends when the structural and cyclical changes in the economy may or may not reinforce the effectiveness of past models to work. Diversifying your investment is the only way to be safe and earn. Then you must know nothing about them. Please go read more on USDT scam. They are not currencies. This example is something to remember thanks 🤑 So MF is like an arranged marriage? Well I'm certainly looking to sell them this year itself if I'd want to buy a car. And investing in mutual funds sounds really boring and non returning because of such long blocking period like 3 years. Hahah what? Somehow I'm super confused Anything you do with the intent of generating wealth is investing. Even the person buying a lottery ticket or gambling in a casino are technically investing money for the extremely low odds of making unrealistically high returns. \\n\\nWhen people are naive enough to see  crypto currency trade or foreign currency trade as investment instruments, what's wrong with people seeing seeing real estate as investment too. There is inherent risk with investment. People take risks to reap rewards and they should be just as ready to make losses for poor judgement. Real estate has the advantage that it's a physical entity and a limited resource. It has its own risks if you are looking at it as a investment option, but there is no downside to holding a bit of property.\\n\\nOn the other hand, people don't put money in banks or fixed deposits to generate wealth. These are savings instruments and meant to be a safety net. They generate none to negative returns after accounting for inflation. Furthermore, people are literally forced by the govt to put their money in banks. Yet, that safety net that the govt is forcing you to use is so fragile. Property rates might take a fall in the coming years when the supposed bubble bursts, but aren't rents bound to increase as expected? Gold, MF, ULIPs (SCAM!), Endowment Plans (SCAM!) are like Arranged marriages. So, the probability that a Arranged marriage is a SCAM is high You’re mistaking MF with ELSS. You can sell a MF. There has to be demand too the structural changes right now are that companies and people are trying to reduce their footprints.  With emergence of e-commerce, co-working spaces, room sharing. Office spaces keep moving from area to area and valuations spike up till no one can really afford them. Like during the bitcoin nvaluation spike, no one could really sell them. It’s a checkmate. Price will eventually drop to meet the demand. At any time ? \"},\n",

Using Rupay cards online is kind off an issue, doesn't work with Netflix India either :/ I don't even know this.\\n\\nDigital payments are a cluster fuck at this point. The government wants to wash it's hands in every thing. They had a chance to centralize and open source the digital payment mechanism in India but what they ended up doing is creating a spaghetti out of the banks and digital payments apps. Nope. Tried to register my dad's SBI rupay card it's not working and I didn't see any international transaction options for rupay card in internet banking. Yeah.. can’t sign up for any any trials too with rupay :/ Oh okay got it. An off topic questions.. how do you apply for a visa or MasterCard? Mine is basically a new account with relatively lower transactions volume wise. Would the bank still approve? (sbi bank) Yeah, kind of a waste. They are easy to obtain, everybody seems so eager to hand them out, would've been great for trials :P In internet banking -> e-services ->ATM card services ->request new card . I have 3 options contactless international visa/mastercard and rupay . It should be available to all users Yeah ikr and btw is there a rule or something that banks need to handout Rupay cards when someone opens a new account? When I opened my sbi account I specifically asked for a visa or MasterCard but they sent me a Rupay card 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ Okay thanks! All I can guess is that Rupay cards are cheaper for them to issue compared to VISA/MasterCard, hence this fucktardry. Though the one good thing about these (assuming they issued RuPay Platinum) is that you get free lounge access at the domestic airports, so there's that. the transaction cost of visa and MasterCard is higher as compared to rupay.\\nvisa, amex etc are processed abroad while rupay is all indian \"},\n",

I\\'ve had delivery drivers literally go missing with my food, or they\\'ll give me a completely wrong order, and then refuse to refund anything. Worst of all, if this happens after midnight, other places in my area close down and the only thing I\\'ll get to have for dinner that day is a dozen servings of \"Sorry sir, apologies for the inconvenience.\"\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t happen all the time, but when it does it really sucks and they\\'re incredibly unhelpful. I\\'ve paid for 2 or 3 orders worth 500+ bucks where I never saw the food before I stopped using Zomato except for Gold when eating out. Aye, This breaks my heart!\\n\\nI was loyal customer of Uber eats since like start of 2018! At least in my area Uber eats was the best. \\n\\nGood offers, timely delivery and great customer service!\\n\\nGodspeed Uber Eats, You will be missed... 😭 Sucks for international travelers who would only have Uber on their phones Uber Eats was better than Zomato  . \\n\\nThey had better offers , better delivery, better service \\n\\nZomato is still a lil clumpy and I don\\'t think this is good for consumers as it can result in Monopoly...\\n\\nLets hope Swiggy ups the game fuck man! Uber eats was my favourite with all the discounts! Zomato is the worst! now only Swiggy remains\\n\\nRIP 19 rs orders, 39 rs orders, 59 rs orders.. will miss them! Going to miss those outrageous discounts compared to zomato and swiggy Hope the employees and delivery guys are not fired. RIP Uber Eats. For me, it was always  Uber Eats> Swiggy> Zomato [deleted] Ubereats was a saving grace for me back in college when it had just begun in Chennai. Guess all the undercuts bit them in their ass Well, this paves a much cleaner way for Amazon to enter the market and if that happens, Zomato would be their first kill in my opinion.\\n Zomato has horrendous customer service while Amazon has one of the best ( in my opinion) Uber Eats failed to read the Indian market in food delivery. \\n\\nThey focused on app design rather than adding more quality restaurants. I liked to use their app but it simply never had as many options as Swiggy or Zomato. \\n\\nFor now, Swiggy remains to be the best app for food delivery. Bummer for me because I always felt customer service was better in Uber eats.\\n\\nAlso gave great offers which I think might have led to losses and ultimately the sale to Zomato This is sad! I ordered twice from Ubereats yesterday. Didn\\'t know this would happen when I woke up. :/ My last Uber Eats order was just day before yesterday, they had massive subway offers all the time, overall their offers were much better and extremely professional when it came to delivery and handling, but I\\'d agree 80% of my orders were from swiggy and zomato. There were a few exclusive places in UE which I used order from because of offers and quality food. I guess those listings would get merged now. Oh crap Ubereats was really good and cheap compared to both rivals. I walk to the restaurant. That way, you\\'ll get your order faster in Bangalore. So now the final war is between swiggy and Zomato? Zomato offers are nothing but adjustment and rounding off This is happening everywhere in the world. Deliveroo recently closed down in Germany, selling everything to the last remaining competition Lieferando, one of the shittiest delivery services. \\n\\nAt least you have 2 options in India. Some places have only one! this i one news that has zero impact to me. i neither have ubereats, nor zomato, nor swiggy. i feel that these apps exploit the producers of food and are causing a lot of damage to the restaurant industry. i prefer to visit a restaurant, talk to the owner/staff, get to know then and i enjoy my meal more than an order in. This is why the free market sucks. Duopoly now and the customer gets screwed Thanks Uber eats for the memories Khana khau ki bc apps download karu? Zomato ate uber eats Man, this sucks. Uber Eats had great offers and seemed affordable compared to the other two. Also, their customer service was miles ahead of others, at least for me. Zomato still owes me ₹130 I think. Pretty weird why they did it. It was a dead company. The user base was overlapping. For 3 50 million dollars, they have not acquired anything ground breaking. Its just waste of precious money. It will be duopoly as it is other sectors too. More discounts on the way! Very bad Uber bhuko ka sasta sahara Investors - wait for the dip and buy $UBER. They got 10% stake in swiggy and zomato from a loss making segment which now also means more customers to swiggy and zomato. Does it mean uber ears will not be a part of my uber app? Zomato eats Uber Eats! I\\'m sticking to my pledge to never order cooked food from such apps. I either cook my food or go out for a nice dinner at a restaurant. Not gonna get into the habit of outsourcing \\'cooking\\' food for myself. Quick question: Why was it an all-stock transaction and not a cash or partially cash transaction?\\n I mean, imo, cash transaction is better than all-stock transaction in terms of operational freedom and profit sharing. Remember Letsbuy guys? Softbank pressure all around All these complaints against zomato are very surprising to me. I have never used Uber Eats and I believe you all who are saying good things. But zomato never messed up any order, and their delivery guys are pretty good. I always go back & forth between zomato & swiggy and choose the one giving a better deal. Swiggy has given me 1 or 2 mess ups but zomato never. F\\n\\nWish they sold it to Swiggy atleast. RIP uber eats This is why you go eat then & there, problem solved!\\nJust gotta use those at night sometimes tho. [deleted] Maybe those heavy discounts were the reason they are losing money and had to sell. Classic uber model. Raise money from investors to crush competitors even at an extreme loss, and once a significant market share is reached, exploit the market from both producers and consumers. They failed to do that here in their own, hence they agreed to team up. I wonder after Zomato acquiring it whether the discounts would continue Try Faasos. It\\'s the cheapest, they don\\'t have crazy delivery and packing charges and the food is pretty good too! Swiggy jacks up the price. I once selected 50% off option with Swiggy super enabled, while I was in the restaurant. There was a difference of about 30% after the 50% off coupon was applied. \\n\\nUber eats failed because their UI sucked and was a hassle to get orders, while every other food delivery company was touting fake 50% off sales. Basically JC Penney of food business. What happens if you have accounts in both places. Mine is stuck.\\n\\nEdit: Fixed It\\'s been 10 minutes. Still stuck at \\'get started\\' page. Yay aaj se daily party. Email campaigns are scheduled. They probably forgot to stop it. Protip - use cash on delivery and pay online once the guy shows up if you don\\'t have cash. These things happened to me too. Yup. And there\\'s no phone call option for Zomato. There\\'s only so much one can chat. I stay away from it usually. Zomato has the worst customer service. you order something and you get something else. There is no way to contact a customer service agent. all you get is the chatbot and \\'apologies for the inconvenience\\' message. +1 Up you go. If your dispute with Zomato goes sideways and you paid via Credit Card, can’t you just issue a chargeback? +1. This has happened many times in this exact narrative. I steer clear of using zomato for my late night deliveries. I live in the US and there are other food delivery services which are better than uber eats. Buy in any case, all of them refund you or offer to re-deliver the food if something goes wrong. No questions asked. This is really something I admire that for many businesses here customers always come first.\\n\\nSomething the Indian businesses can really work on. When I came to India, I had disappointing experience from both swiggy and zomato. +1 Same thing. Once they offered me food from a completely different restaurant and no bill. \"Sorry for inconvenience, here is a coupon for 35rs\" was the only reply I got from Zomato. Told them to fuck off and deleted the app straightaway. Now they can offer me food for free, but I still won\\'t take it. Still a better option to just call the restaurant because they don\\'t charge me some random deliver fee and late night fee and other dozen fee. [deleted] They can download another app, can they not? Oh don\\'t even get me started on how India has no sense of accomodating international travellers or people who live outside. Half the apps require OTP on a mobile phone. \\n\\nOh and it gets worse. I was locked out of my own bank account all off a sudden while I was out of the country cause it started requiring an OTP for a password reset cause there was a password renewal policy added out of the blue. This was a huge bank not some local no name. I called customer care and they literally couldn\\'t even change the OTP number on my account to my dad\\'s phone since it requires me physically being there. I couldn\\'t literally access my own bank account for 6 months until I came back to India for vacation cause of the stupid OTP policy. EVERY bank in US works with emails being used for validation along with phone numbers. Seriously what happens if a person doesn\\'t have a local number? Half the apps won\\'t work and can\\'t use bank services. Delivery guys can easily jump between zomato, swiggy and uber. At present also many delivery guys work zomato, swiggy, uber eats at a time.\\nAnd for office employees, some of them will definitely be fired. Zomato will not absorb Uber Eats’ team in India. This means around 100 executives will either be reallocated to Uber’s other verticals here or laid off. I find Zomato Gold and eating outside really expensive. 🤔 How fren ? I click go to Zomato and then nothing happens on Zomato homepage 🥺 Only if you used Uber Eats for at least one order after July 1 2019. Uber Eats\\' app design was good? Nope. It was one clumsy app. Even after using too many times I still don\\'t have a good muscle memory of their layout.\\n\\nSwiggy on the other hand, has the best user experience out of the three. Not intrusive, the learning curve is almost flat. Where was the app design? They barely changed since 2017 for me. UPI never came for me there while my friends got 500+ from GPay scratch cards back in 2018! I had so many times got food delivered in the wrong address but the same problems never happened to me in swiggy or zomato. Something in their UI kept making my eyes ignore the green tooltip about different address. Guessing app design comes from the US app, or did they make India specific changes? Imo it means they weren\\'t tuned into improving the experience in India I wish Uber eats could\\'ve taken over Zomato. Gonna miss those subway offers from now on At least it\\'s two Indian companies. Hope these idiots can at least breakeven and become sustainable businesses. >  i neither have ubereats, nor zomato, nor swiggy\\n\\nBhai bhai Bhai Do you prefer a government controlled monopoly? Or a free market duopoly which can compete against each other for prices? I swear some of you idiots don\\'t know how the world works. You\\'re born in a great time of prosperity. Appreciate it. Shh, don’t make the Libertarians mad now. Softbank? More like duopoly. I heard someone say about Uber- Your every ride is being partly funded with VC money they will be redirected to zomato so no Everything\\'s frozen at faasos. I can\\'t call that good food. > Faasos\\n\\nI can\\'t read of them and not get a picture in my mind of that wrap-sandwich picture they posted in the shape of Modi doing a Yoga pose on a rock. What do you mean by yours is stuck? My gold membership got extended by 3 months. Click on the cross sign from top left. I dont think Uber eats or swiggy have call option US customers won\\'t be abusing the system as much as Indians. Even Amazon Flipkart had no questions asked returns earlier, they stopped it for electronics 3 paneer parathas for 100. Ah good days Damn you refreshed some old memories. Remember when Kapila Kati roll was 40 something. How do I rewind time? true man Chaitanya paratha for 39 wtf! Yep. \\n\\nBiryani\\'s of Kaveri, PK and all that will be no more... :( [deleted] I still can’t use Ola card payments because they require a PAN card. Have to resort to Uber. India is extremely traveler unfriendly. Yeah the problem downloading these India specific apps is that you need a India specific phone number to receive OTPs and shit, which not all international travelers will have. OTP inherently isn\\'t bad...I just wish they gave better options, like an Authenticator app. Email is ok too, but the Indian banks seem to ask for an OTP for everything, even after signing in. Sign in, OTP. Make a bill payment, OTP. Send money to someone else, OTP. Just gets real tiresome real fast. Rapido. Devs will surely be laid off. Ironic since its the managers who kept UberEats in that shitty UI since its inception. zomato gold delivery u mean? Zomato Gold costs around ₹100 a month now. It isn\\'t very expensive in my opinion. It is now applicable on delivery orders too. I clicked the button, Zomato opened. And I checked my Gold Membership. It showed 3 months. Try to use \"EATS\" code The Uber app is the same and works both in India and US, so I guess it Ubereats would be the same Both have some common foreign investors if I\\'m not wrong > At least it\\'s two Indian companies.\\n\\nWhy is this a consideration?\\n\\n> Hope these idiots can at least breakeven\\n\\nI bet those guys running multi-billion companies know a thing or two more that yourself. Their investor [deleted] I wonder how this will impact sales\\n\\nI\\'m not a price averse buyer but I\\'ve skipped ordering several times when I\\'ve headed to the checkout page and found a few hundred extra rupees in delivery/packing/convenience fees What happened to foodpanda Oligopoly. Monopoly. Both are funded by Tencent. That\\'s sad. Maybe their good differs from outlet to outlet? That sucks. It routes to the Zomato app and says in an overlay my account is ready. Then its forever loading when I press the get started button. Possibly some bad mapping algorithm if they are planning to merge accounts.\\n\\nedit: Yup my phonenumber got delinked from my account. Had to reenter. Don\\'t stick your pp in wrong places It just cancels whatever it was doing. It doesn\\'t show any Zomato gold offer activated. Swiggy does. No idea about UE. Sadly this is true See, I understand this, and that\\'s why I never like \"No questions asked\" policy. Ask questions all you want. It is just that if there is a genuine issue, be ready to apologize and fix the problem. Sadly none of Indian businesses know this basic thing. Just today, I deleted my Amazon account because of same problem. 5 years of prime membership and thousands spent every month on purchases. And then they told me \"Sir, we know purchase failed due to our fault, but the deal is now over so you have to pay 20% extra\". I don\\'t want \"no questions asked\" policies. I just want them to be genuine. If I buy biryani and receive burger, just refund without any bullshit. No need to refund because \"taste was not good\" or \"too spicy food\" type reasons. 3 fat samoli shawarmas for 110bucks in Hyderabad using Ola-FoodPanda was my lunch and dinner 2 years ago. Kapila Kati nahi pata. But BBC ka Burger I do. yeah man you are a bigger person than all of us. Neither have I. But job ke liye Bangalore aana pada. No more home made food.\\n\\nF The delhi airport does not even have free wifi. It requires an otp Generally when I travel abroad I get a prepaid sim for the lowest amount of minutes + data, also people can use a burner app to get an Indian number, but I think there are ways of filtering out those numbers. Couldn\\'t devs be moved easily to some other branch of Uber? Seems like a mistake to let go of existing employees who can work on some other part of the company without going through all the hiring hoops. It was costing 540₹ per annum just few days ago and there\\'s this offer where if you dine out and pay using Zomato at a gold restaurant you\\'ll get 2 months extension so this means Zomato gold costed me 38₹ per month, at least to me.\\n\\nSo this is not *that* much of a good deal as people make it out to be. Many gold restaurants have reduced their discounts now and gold on delivery sucks, at least where I live.\\n\\nIt\\'s still worth it but Zomato gold was much better last year than it is now despite costing less rn. Thank you ☺️ Is it softbank ? >Why is this a consideration?\\n\\nBecause it does matter that Indian companies are able to outcompete competitors with multiple times the funding. It creates more high-value-added jobs in India and inspires others to try to build competent domestic firms instead of simply working for an American one.\\n\\nYou sound like you\\'ve been reading too much American content.\\n\\n>I bet those guys running multi-billion companies know a thing or two more that yourself.\\n\\nHah. They likely do, - but they have different objectives than me as a consumer.\\n\\nThey are stuck in a game-theoretic prisoners dilemma where they cannot stop burning money until the other side does too - but if they burn longer than the other they can run the other out of business.\\n\\nIf both behave \\'rationally\\' and keep burning money then one or both will go bust - leading to any survivor monopolizing the market and having extremely high pricing power. If they talk to each other they \\'collude\\' and can be subject to anti-trust investigation.\\n\\nI would prefer both to survive so that there is still some competition left in the marketplace - but a sustainable kind not characterized by OPEX burn. This has not been possible for anyone since the discounting strategy has far too lucrative in the delivery space for any newcomer to ignore.\\n\\nYou REALLY sound like you\\'ve been reading too much mainstream American bullshit. Except for Zomato gold orders, I always find swiggy to have the lowest prices, especially with swiggy super. Ubereats was cheaper till 2018 I guess but the delivery charge used to go high too much too often. Dude Swiggy (with subscription) is consistently cheaper than Zomato. In tier 3 cities of UP, Swiggy rules! Interesting. In Chennai, I find Swiggy to be cheaper than Zomato and Uber Eats. Which city are you from? They moved to serving Tier-1 and office spaces only. Dam I thought it took a lot more than 10 cents to fund a startup /s I mean it\\'s allright if you like it. It\\'s just that they have packaged food which they reheat in a microwave. It\\'s the same at all outlets I think that\\'s just their business model. Same with places like Charcoal Eats. Hence they tend to deliver very quickly too. That\\'s how fast food works sadly. same here!! It\\'s irritating! Just use code Eats while ordering to get the discounts. No need to do anything. There\\'s no profile merging as UberEats only shutting down the app for India. What did you do when it got stuck? Mine is still stuck on that page only. Logout of your Zomato before doing this and it won\\'t get stuck. Did you solve it? Mine is still stuck at the same place. Click on your profile icon on right top > Zomato Gold > Your Membership. [I always love a nice BBC](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BBC) Oh 😞😭. This pisses me off to no end. And then they have the gall to put fucking payphones outside the airport and \"no way\"* to get back into the airport once you\\'re out.\\n\\n\\\\* You can bribe the m/f\\'ers of course, but how is a foreigner going to know that? Same for Mumbai. Fucking stone age policies. I travel a lot and literally even ghetto airports of the world give free wifi without needing a phone number. Literally the whole point of airport wifi is to help out international travellers to contact their family and make their lives easier. \\n\\nWhoever runs the network department at airports and made the design choice. FUCK YOU. When I come in from the US, because of the locked phone nonsense, I get an international plan that lets me use my AT&T phone In India but that means I’ll keep my US number. Usually can still get an OTP but it requires some configuring properly for it to work. Since ubereats app is defunct, the code knowledge is no longer needed. They are no different from any other dev looking for work. Ola modified existing Foodpanda code core level so they needed the foodpanda devs for the knowledge. Not the case for Zomato. > You REALLY sound like you\\'ve been reading too much mainstream American bullshit.\\n\\nBhai, I hardly wrote two sentences, and one of that was a question. Itna judgemental kyon? [deleted] Swiggy has great after sales tbh. I can cancel the order midway if I change my mind (It\\'s rare though) and they\\'ve replaced items hassle free if something was missing, and even ended up giving full refund in a couple of cases. Okay. Will check. Thanks. [deleted] Nope it doesn\\'t work like that! EATS not working for all if you dont merge I already have Zomato gold, do I get the 3months extended or do I get nothing.\\n\\nEdit: I get nothing.\\n\\nEdit: I got mail it has been extended now. I closed the box. The discount worked for me. It didn\\'t get stuck but nothing happened. Landed back on Zomato homepage with account logged in 😅 maybe some server issue Checked there only. It\\'s not showing any gold membership. i got zomato gold...are other coupons still applicable after claiming free dish ? Burger Barn Cafe dude Sometimes its used to surge to 40+ which put me off. That and over time, Swiggy\\'s ui and search functionality for dishes being accurate made me lose interest in others. Not shilling ofc. I search on swiggy and then order from zomato gold restaurants lol.\\n\\nUberEats hardly changed their UI from 2017. Yes. Way better than Zomato customer service.\\n\\nZomato chat feels like it\\'s controlled by monkeys. I agree. Swiggy is mostly expensive than Uber Eats in Bangalore unless they introduce some big discounts, which doesn\\'t happen often. It worked for me, I got 50% off on a order. I didn\\'t press the get started button though. 🤔 Check Zomato Gold > Your membership. It\\'s only for those who placed an order on Uber Eats after July 1 2019. For me it just added up. Although the membership months are the same \\'12 months remaining\\' it just added 3 months and says it\\'s valid till April for me I merged my account and got it even though I had Gold already. Guess you need to be signed into both apps? How you got this. Mine just got stuck after clicking get started. I already have zomato gold. I got it without clicking on next. Server problem maybe, try again after sometime. Just log out from Zomato and then go to uber eats and go to Zomato. It\\'ll work. Lmao great to see such dynamic opinions about online food ordering services. I personally dislike them all, Uber Eats the most. They are expensive, mislead their prices and have no after sales. Swiggy SUPER is a rip off. Earlier SUPER costed 149 inr and when the time came to renew it, they hacked it up to 799inr for me. Yes just for me. Now you might say \"They were giving it out on discounted prices.\" and to that I say it is like those Flat 50% off sales where they bloat their prices and give a discount on that. Fairly enough, I didn\\'t renew my membership and sooner than later I got a call explaining me the benefits of the membership and when I didn\\'t budge, the price came back down to 149 inr. \\n\\n\\n\\nAlso to break even on the benefits of the membership I would have had to spend ₹60000 on Swiggy in a year at the very least if the membership costed 799. And to make it more appealing they suddenly started charging ₹90 (₹30 delivery charges + ₹60 some new distance charges) when ordering from restaurants which previously charged ₹10 as delivery charges. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZomato suffers from bloated restaurant prices in my area. Absolutely. Swiggy started as a logistics company unlike Zomato and really has idea and experience to what they are doing. without merging? >Zomato is giving 50% off on next three orders and 3 months Zomato Gold trial if you click on \"Go to Zomato\" from   \\n>  \\n>UberEats app.  \\n>  \\n> (Thanks to   \\n>  \\n>u/JPBabuaFromOttawa  \\n>  \\n>)\\n\\nCan confirm-3 additional months of membership. Yep, got it now. Yep, done now > they hacked it up to 799inr for me.\\n\\nDude what? It has been costing me 129 every 3months.\\n\\nI got gold for 600 bucks last year and with the deliveries it has become really cost effective for me. Miscellaneous charges hover around ~50 which is a bit triggering but its still worth.\\n\\nSwiggy is still good UI and support wise. Zomatos UI looks someone pooped everywhere. Yeah, without merging. Yes Zomato\\'s UI is complete and utter trash. What Swiggy does is that they price their membership at 799 and discount it down to 149 for everyone. Then they analyze who is more likely to buy the membership at their absolutely jarring prices and remove the discount specifically for them. Someone on Twitter called them out and they replied with something along the lines that the discounts are user targetted and everyone gets unique discounts. This discount practice is just a guise for their non consumer friendly money bloat. '},\n",

       "  'comments': 'Jindal Law University’s LLB was 42 lakhs. The Dhirubhai Ambani International School has annual fees of over 4 lakh last I checked. Even when our billionaires get into “philanthropy”, they consider it a revenue model! It’s like they’re obliging us by making money off education or health and not another factory. There should be a separate tax slab for billionaires, tax them 50%, their CSR are mainly for a show and they sure as hell not giving back to the society what they take from it. Interesting to see clueless defenders of elites! Having money in stocks vs Having money in cash are two different things. When money in stocks, you should treat them more as custodians of wealth rather than cash hoarders. We need to follow South Korean model of inheritance tax For starters, union budget is an annual sum of money; wealth is accumulated over a lifetime (or more). Secondly, this wealth is not lying idle, and certainly not as cash. Thirdly, there is no one way of taxing wealth. Ultra rich business families marry within themselves and hence any dilution in share holdings for taxation purposes will simply be bought up by a related family. Also, the ultra rich have ways and means of tax evasion beyond the ordinary. I think given the scenario, family shareholding beyond a certain percentage should be discouraged, either by inheritance tax or other means like Indian private banks. Additionally, we need to encourage dilution of small percentage of shares for charitable purposes, while ensuring proper distributive justice both in stock holding and wealth distribution Wait, why are we comparing totals and rates again?\\n\\nThis is like those other clickbait headlines where they compare GDPs and billionaire wealth. The rich keep on getting richer and the poor are getting more poorer. Interesting to see people want to tax the rich 50%. Coz that can’t go wrong, hand over more money to the corrupt government. Banana Republic All you retards don\\'t even know that most of this wealth is in the stock price of their companies.\\n\\nIf they sell, the price crashes and so does the \"wealth\".\\n\\nClueless kids. [deleted] It\\'s Oxfam again with it\\'s bullshit. Not all money exists in form of cash hoarding. Most of the assets of rich people exist in form of investments in different sectors. Taxing the rich more will make sure that that money will be pulled out of investments which is blood for developing country like India.\\n\\nComparison with Nordic countries is absurd as Nordic countries have very free markets and strong economies. Infact they have lower corporate taxes than US. Indian economy can\\'t compare to them. This gobbled up idea that billionaire=bad and tax=virtue is stupid and more socialist policies will yield disastrous results not for rich people but for middle class and the poor. Is the fact that you\\'re comparing assets and expenditure an apples and oranges comparison not hurt anyone? inb4 \\'whose wealth is whose\\' fight This blows my mind! Can someone explain how adding taxes makes a difference to them.\\n\\nSee a multi billionaire with a listed company has his car paid by the company, his home staff paid by the company, his credit card is the corporate card(paid by the company) his children holidays are too paid by the company saying they are interns and all. \\n\\nDoesn’t make sense To me. acche din aa gaye Year 2200: still Waiting for it to trickle down. This is not how wealth works. These billionaires don\\'t have that money sitting in bank accounts. Sensationalist article for simple minds. Wealth is created, consumed, and owned. Its a mistake to only compare wealth owned. If we compare wealth created, and wealth consumed, we will find a different picture.\\n\\nThe rich, actually create a lot of wealth in their lifetime, and when they die, they leave behind a lot of wealth that they didn\\'t consume. In fact while they live, they focus on reinvesting wealth to generate even more wealth.  Till they die. That\\'s why they are so rich.\\n\\nIf we look at total wealth consumed in a year, I think that the distribution between the rich and poor would not be as Stark as the distribution of wealth owned. If you get rid of dividend distribution tax and tax dividend income at destination according to income tax slabs, that will go a long way in discouraging wealth accumulation. DDT should only apply to overseas/offshore investors.\\n\\nWealth tax or inheritance tax however are both bad ideas, because they discourage people from building legacies, and because they encourage people to become tax exiles. Tax the rich! Funny how the article presents the numbers as Billionaires vs Union Budget. Instead of handful of billionaires vs Rest of Indians. Fucking socialists with their value labour theory in the comments . Stop reading 100 year old failed ideologies and get with the times. Taxation is theft and a wealth tax is double theft. FUCK SOCIALISM. Income inequality is a huge issue, no doubt. However, comparing wealth accumulated over years and the net worth of individuals to a yearly budget is not the right measure in my opinion. Wealth isn’t created out of thin air, and many billionaires and millionaires slog to achieve wealth. Moreover, a lot of the ‘net worth’ is not liquid and in stock/other assets. As billionaires, we pay our taxes diligently, as required by law. The comments sections read that billionaires should be taxed even more, like Scandinavian countries. My question is, what do I get in return? If I pay 60% income tax+GST on all products and still have to live in cities with infrastructure 5-10 years behind the global standard, what encourages my to pay? Why should I? I see a lot of people just hating these billionaires because they are so poor.\\n\\nThey are just couple of jealous bastards who can\\'t earn much so they don\\'t want others to earn as well. Billionaires have two choices, either pay huge amount of taxes, or donate significant amount of their Networth to build a foundation that supports the deprived. They can do both, but it\\'s most likely they will build a foundation and make an agreement with the Government to pay lesser taxes, they could pretend that they just donated more than 90% of their Networth to a cause, but it\\'s still their money, they still have control over it. Let\\'s say the more money they have, more the control over it. For a well-functioning capitalist system of economy Income inequality doesn\\'t matter some Billionaires making more than hundreds of millions of people doesn\\'t matter, such data is even irrelevant. Empirically stating, more the Billionaires seems like better the economy, but this could be wrong, this could even be an unregulated capitalist economy that is out of bounds with socialist principles. Governments around the world should have a systematic plan to turn billionaires into millionaires So what? Hmm. There\\'s income inequality and then there\\'s this shit Not all are Tatas. Ambanis are worst bizfamily. Jindal law produces twats n cunts for whom 42 lakhs is just nothing. \\n\\nObviously they oblige us. Instead of making their antillas they made schools n hospitals, we should be grateful to them for their ultimate sacrifice. India definitely should have inheritance tax. All these scions of big businesses men have it easy. Tax inheritance beyond a certain amount to such that it forces the company to go public. Like we already do for banks. Some Nordic countries and other European countries have 60% tax slab on ultra rich. And the those countries are really rich too. I guess with so many people here hung up on \"why tax the hardworking? \" it\\'s not likely implemented anytime soon.\\n\\nEdit: it seems like maximum is around 60% not 80%. Pardon my ignorance. So they will leave country and stop investing in a developing country for creating deadweight losses for the government. I don\\'t find it right. They have taken risks thats why they are getting rewards. You can\\'t penalize them by putting taxes this is highly demoralizing for those who wants to work and earn more. Yes. This will work well. So that they will fly away and we will be back  in 70s. We already have indira 2.0 ruling right  now. Brilliant idea. I wonder sometimes socialist in India blame capatalism for inequality when we are socialist country. promote cashless transactions, digitisation of land and repair GST, you will get your due share of tax. Watch the [The Laundromat](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80994011) if you haven\\'t already. \\n\\nMost rich people have very little \"income\" of their own. They\\'ve sponsored their own tax loop holes and company ownership roles to keep their money. >they sure as hell not giving back to the society what they take from it\\n\\nThey are giving back what they are getting from society. Take PayTM/ Reliance for instance. Will you purchase their services if you think they are not worth your money? No, right? So you give them money and they return you their services/products. No point of taxing them more than others.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt also looks like you want to tax them just because they are rich. You have to understand that most of the tax government earns goes to corrupt hands so you are just forcing them to give their earned money to corrupt hands, most of the money won\\'t reach the common people. They by default fall under a higher tax bracket. But point here being did they become rich by robbing something, NO, then why the hell people are jealous of their hard earned millions?\\n\\nMy point is, they reached there by running their companies and they gave employment to masses. [deleted] Most people who are financially struggling generally do not see themselves as poor but rather as millionaires in waiting. If you are being harsh on the ultra wealthy, these people think that one day (\"when\" they make it) you will do the same to them. So they make it their duty to defend billionaires, despite the fact that the billionaires themselves wouldn\\'t give a second thought about fucking them over if it meant more accumulation of wealth for themselves. People defend the elites, including in most capitalist countries because they see it as a testament to how simple men can make it big too. I am not talking about it\\'s validity, just stating why many do so. This is true and needs to be said whenever these X number of people hold Y amount of total wealth in a society/world narratives get shown. It is misleading.  \\n\\nHowever it is also true that non-liquid assets like stock/land etc are real as well. They are real because they give access to corridors of power, networks and influence. Meaning the end result is basically the same, if not worse because taxing them is hard and they are having power without accountability.  \\n\\nIn fact trying to force them to wash that money can even be counter productive because if ultra wealthy were forced to spend they would do so on issues that matters to them and there is no guarantee if that will be positive things.  \\nIt could be making a media platform which does bad faith things, it could be investments which are exploitative. Or it could be made to peddle ideologies of the rich person which may be good or okay but could also be bad. \\n\\nThe best approach is still to limit people becoming so rich in the first place or rather to limit the gap that arises between the rich and the less well off. If that gap is reasonable the less well off are not all that bothered and are more willing to accept people who are ultra wealthy because their own lives are reasonable. \\n\\nInequality is a biological driver, it is not a social construct which arises among modern humans. Human don\\'t react to inequality and unfairness on good terms and that is not social, that is biological. Even other primate and simian species have shown this behavior in testing. Longer this current approach continues we are risking disaster of the social order. Custodians of whose wealth? They likely profited from cheap labor and tax avoidance. Custodians of greed that benefit from a distracted population fighting amongst themselves over religious differences. I think I\\'d make a good custodian. How about you? This. It always annoys me to read these same articles comparing assets to cash flow. It\\'s like comparing apples to oranges Stock vs flow in economics The annual union budget is an absolute number, not a rate. Same for the total wealth of Indian billionaires. Hooid The rich dont even pay the tax slab of the middle class anyways. They have cutting edge lawyers and accountants to defy all taxes. We can change the govt. Can\\'t install another in the place of Nita Ambani We need an Onion Republic! How the fck does recognising that the obscene amount of inequality in India (and the world) is unsustainable make one a Marxist? If India does not get it’s act together you will be looking at a much worse version of Brazil in a few years. The fact that 1% of the population has more wealth than 70% of the population is straight up unethical. Who is Marxist Lenin? Who the fuck is Marxist-Lenin? So your assesment is one that the market is not free enough - even if I agree with you that free market means no govt pressure and not oligarchical markets held by govt protectionism and plundering the global south - and that there are a lot of corporate taxes here. And your claim that corporate taxes in nordic countries are low is absurdly false, and in addition they have a lot of socialist policies you and your neoliberal il will shudder at.\\n\\nand two that we can\\'t take black money away from the rich otherwise that will choke the markets run by that black money. Sir ji aap itne great ho na main kya bataun. vaah. I can bet my right kidney that you don\\'t own any capital other than some shares here and there. You\\'re the equivalent of a farmer in medieval times who thinks that paying 80% of their grain to the king will make them more prosperous somehow. What if I told you socialism has nothing to do with taxes? \" Moreover, a lot of the ‘net worth’ is not liquid and in stock/other assets.\"\\n\\n\"A lot\" is partly accurate... try \"Almost all of it\" \"slog to achieve wealth\" lol must be really difficult for them Yeah, like Ambani\\'s kids totally \"earned\" all that money. No one is hating on billionaires. We just want that they pay the appropriate taxes. Your \"favorite\" billionaires like Warren Buffet and Mark Cuban both have said they should be taxed higher. Not sure who exactly you\\'re defending here. The situation here is similar to the prisoners dilemma. There will always be a tiny ass island which would not agree and all the companies/billionaires would flood to that country/city state. \\n\\nBillionaires with their power would not even let it to come to this situation. Even the government of the most rich and powerful country i.e. US is controlled and owned by the ultra rich. So to implement this in all over the world is practically impossible. Not to mention the corporate tax cuts. Does inheritance tax work differently if I inherit debt? Political fundings for both BJP and Congress come from ultra rich, that is the reason they\\'re not heavily taxed in India.\\n\\nBut most of our people are led to believe that Billionaires are angels that create jobs and donate, while not seeing the real picture. No European country has a top marginal tax rate of 80%.it\\'s much closer to 60%. They rich don\\'t have a really big income, what they have is too much wealth. Income tax is not charged on wealth. I don\\'t think that can ever work in India.\\n\\nIn either case most millionaires and billionaires are leaving India each year regardless. If tax slabs are increased to Nordic level.\\n\\nIndia will see huge chunk of billionaires leaving India and settling abroad. \\n\\nYou can literally get citizenship of any country for the right price. I don\\'t understand the argument of \\'why tax hardworking\\'. Then, why should anyone who earns more than 3 lpa pay tax, abolish the income tax completely and get the money through indirect taxes. How is the work of a billionaire \\'hard\\' and not someone earning less working for almost the same time. [deleted] Nordics are somewhere around 50-55% for maximum taxation iirc. \\n\\nWestern Europe max out at 45% I think. \\n\\nUnsure about the rest. Exactly, their should be cap on tax, why treat them like they did some crime by earning more.\\n\\nthey already pay upto 42.7% That is very big amount already, \\n\\nRather than this, government should actually use money like kejriwal is doing, so that people will happily pay tax knowing that they will get their better country in return.\\n\\nI will happily pay 50% tax in US than 30% in India. The argument that billionaires worked hard would be very good only if I didn\\'t know Indian system too well. The problem is not the first time billionaires the problem is with dynasties that have accumulated wealth and power(and many times this wealth is created by not so ethical means).\\n\\nThey exhibit anti competitive behavior, engage in lobbying through their family connections to get preferential treatment from govt and finical institutions.\\n\\nThe point that they will leave India is useless they need India they know they can\\'t get this kinda life anywhere else.\\n\\nPS. Here I am talking about top 100 of the country not your regular Joe millionaire Bhai kal ko internet ban ho Jaye toh sab cashless and digitisation Ka fayda nhi. >\\tThey are giving back what they are getting from society.\\n\\nOffering paid goods and services isn’t “giving back”.\\n\\n>\\tWill you purchase their services if you think they are not worth your money? No, right?\\n\\nExcept, you know, when there’s no other alternative. If nobody uses UPI, you have no other choice other than to use PayTM for digital transactions. Right now there’s no alternative to Jio and Airtel, with Vodafone and BSNL in an ambiguous state.\\n\\nYou might point out UPI is extremely popular, to which I’ll reply that it is a government initiative, not a private one.\\n\\n>\\tNo point of taxing them more than others.\\n\\nNo company has grown massive without using up more resources than others. It is only right they give back more than others.\\n\\n>\\tYou have to understand that most of the tax government earns goes to corrupt hands so you are just forcing them to give their earned money to corrupt hands, most of the money won’t reach the common people.\\n\\nAs if corporations and their leaders have been so nice and lovely. People can\\'t comprehend large scales easily. A billionaire has 1000 times more money than a millionaire What\\'s the point of making it if half of the population lives in severe poverty. \\n\\nAnd no, I don\\'t view most of them as rightful philanthropists and hard workers, they are part of the establishment, and they don\\'t want to let go of their stash they made exploiting people. No one needs that amount of money! Any system which has that much of a wage disparity isn\\'t a good system. What\\'s the goal here? Don\\'t you want to see every person to have atleast the basic requirements to live a good life. Working hard won\\'t get you anything. Farmers work hard. Everyone works hard! Sure, people who are good at doing business can be rich. But at the same time people who are not intelligent or capable enough shouldn\\'t have to live like animals. There should be a limit to how much money one person can make. After 1 billion dollars its obscene amount money. I don\\'t know what one can do with all that money. You can buy entire countries for a couple billions.\\n\\nAccording to your statement we shouldn\\'t even tax 30% for above 10L earning guys, since they worked hard to earn the money. That\\'s correct, and if you are taxing them upto 50%, it will significantly reduce their opportunity to invest in startups, big companies and businesses. They have to be investing in our Economy, it\\'s very vital that they do. Yes, build up your strawman and tear it down. Look at US billionares. Jeff Bezos uses donations to Africa and promoting his own Amazon services in ghettos to get massive tax cuts. He and Amazon pay 0 tax. Any attempts to fix the system while keeping the underlying hierarchical structure intact will be co opted by the status quo to strengthen itself even further. 👌👍 Having a stable country is more important than having an unstable country in the off chance that people turn against them. Now it is generally accepted that stability leads to economic growth. That growth will get them more money than what they could get off of chaos. \\n\\nNow this theory goes out the window if they are playing some sort of 4D chess, of course. What does having a lot of land gives you? Anyone who owns large tracts generally has to give it away for development purposes.If they sell their stocks in large go, stocks tank and another person buys it or pension funds. Pension funds own a large amount of stock in many global companies. Sovereigns are wealthy because  they own land, people and money like saudi arabian princes.\\n\\nIf they spend the money, they pay tax If they invest the money, high chance to lose it.\\n\\nHaving wealthy people allows a singular direction of investment. Google/Facebook voting shares owned by certain individuals. or else you risk becoming a middle income country.\\n\\nIf EVs become mainstream, lot of revenue loss for ambani and his debt in JIO or JIO tanks, he has to sell more than certain amount because he pledged shares at certain value.\\n\\nRuias lost their wealth by a large extent by few mistakes and investments.\\n\\nTax avoidance is a major problem. Question is they are worth so much because they are not adequately taxed? Maybe?\\n\\nIt is easy to blame the person with a larger piece of cake. I think hedge fund managers, PE managers and heads of pension funds make a good custodian. Or else all money will be wasted like malaysian sovereign fund. It is literally annual. It\\'s the money spent per year. We\\'re comparing a per-year quantity to a lifetime quantity, for some reason I say no one should pay that much tax. High Tax in any form is a scam. A) that’s a purely hateful assumption \\n\\nB) only some 2 or 3 percent of Indians even pay taxes, so how can you say rich people don’t pay taxes when most of India is poor and doesn’t pay any tax at all? Any data to back this up? Government innately are corrupt no matter who is in power, the best we can do is limit governmental power, while promoting equal opportunity in a democratic free market capitalistic system. South Africa has it the worst and it isn\\'t even helping the country benifit in the long run. I dont think he meant it as an insult. And every reasonable and rational person on the moral right side of things is a marxist. They just haven\\'t read marx to know yet. The ideologues you invoke in an attempt to discredit people when they talk too much common sense. Karl marx and vladimir lenin Norway\\'s whole Socialist policy is on the back of oil. This guy probably watches a lot of these right wing American YouTube channels. No one is saying don\\'t become a rich person. We\\'re just saying that pay your taxes too. A company with revenue in the billions paying 0 corporate taxes definitely is doing something very shady. What if I told you socialism is huge (huge by collecting enormous taxes) government which is an unaccountable entity which always leads to concentration of power in the few people running it and stealing from it.....Don\\'t be shortsighted. Don\\'t you remember the license raj in India which bankrupted the economy. Gosh how dumb are people to be singing songs for socialism. Well, they really took risks, and had the vision to develop something, be it a manufacturing company or a product/service. You don\\'t inherit debt. It is paid off from the estate of the deceased and the remaining assets are distributed among the inheritors according to the will. Why would you inherit debt? Say I don\\'t want it. The sad thing is many Americans somehow believe the same thing even though Americans on average are more educated and well off.  So education likely won’t fix that belief. I don\\'t think you know why that is. India is not a tax haven and India is actually losing millionaires and billionaires to other countries. Yeah my bad read around somewhere 80% for billionaires. I guess I was wrong. Yeah, we are charging on income not how much thier stock is wortth etc. If you earn billions in singles year, then nothing after, you pay only for year you earned billion. Well, good riddance? At least they can\\'t own lots of stuff without citizenship. Seems like I pulled it out of ass. My bad. Edited to 60% Max. If government know that some of them earn illegally they punish them instead of punishing they all Billionaires by increasing tax. Penalize those steps which are illegally taken. Anti-competitive behavior,  I don\\'t find an issue with that until they are legally removing the competitor. Any illegal steps must be punished I agree on that point. Internet is now fundamental part of core institutions (Banking, Services etc) and businesses (Advertisements) . It cannot be completely \"banned\" where these institutions and businesses thrive i.e big population centers consisting of consumers of this businesses.  \\n\\n\\nThis is capitalism. You and I may not agree with it, but where businesses fortify themselves, the government becomes beholden to them. Internet was not banned in bangalore when CAA protests happened. Kashmir and other places digital penetration is very low. 38% of all UPI transactions came from bangalore. Also a millionaire makes 50,000 times the income of a graduate earning 20,000 per month.\\n\\n\\n\\nA millionaire is literally worth in monetary sense 50,000 graduates income. [deleted] [deleted] That money isn\\'t wasted, it\\'s going exactly where the people in control want it to go. People are passing their pockets, that\\'s really all there is to it. The hedge fund and portfolio managers are no different. The concept of wealth distribution has more to do with principle rather than the ability of the individual. And I say this as a holder of a degree in finance. Dude it\\'s the amount of money spent by the government for a population of 1.3 billion in the course of an year. If that amount is less than the life time accumulation of wealth of a few blokes then something is seriously fucked up with the system. I agree. I\\'m very against extreme tax rates like 50%. The taxation needs to be capped at a reasonable rate, else all the richie riches are just gonna store all the money in Swiss Banks or just up and migrate to a western country were taxes are not only reasonable, but worth it. I dont think a data on corruption from a corrupt government is gonna be of any use lol. It is just common knowledge i guess. A lot of tax evasion by the rich happen by routing money through NGO’s, fake philanthropy methods, and other legal/dodgy means. I think i read somewhere that Mukesh Ambani pays zero personal tax and it is in a valid legal way. Typical libertarian bullshit. Haha! Don\\'t agree but a nice comment nonetheless. Yeah, I know who they are. I don\\'t know who Marxist-Lenin is. Seriously? Nothing about their lead in strong manufacturing, IT technology, bionics, space research etc.? All of the money of a tiny wasteland near the Arctic is due to oil? Do a simulation in civilization and replicate the same conditions on a tiny frozen country in ice. Let me know if you can even progress out of the industrial age with just oil lol Libertarian free market capitalism is RiGhT WiNg ideology! In which book does this say so? What if assets are now worth enough to cover debt? \\nDeclare bankruptcy and we are free to go ? Doesn\\'t work that way. their entire mindset about this topic is capitalism - good communism/socialism - bad. They simply don\\'t want to think of this issue without connecting it to communism and communists trying to destroy their country.\\n\\nIs the brain washing that bad in America despite the education? Trickle down economics is a scam used by the rich to bewitch the poor nitwits. We don\\'t need them here just their businesses and capital Good riddance? Even if you believe that millionaires are evil or whatever, they contribute immensely more than others to the economy. \\n\\nNo wonder smart people leave this country, keep being hostile my doods So it\\'s fine to ban internet as long as they are not making any money for govt? I dare them ban internet in NCR, Mumbai, and Bangalore. What good does Jeff Bezos hoarding 100 billion dollars bring to this world? While his workers pee in cups to save time. Society makes it seem like everyone can be rich and powerful if they work hard. But only a handful of us ever get to that position. Our goal should be ensuring that the lower class has the necessities to lead a comfortable life. Not just help the rich become richer. You tell me how many people in India are self made billionaires. I wanna see that hardwork. I habe immense respect for those guys, but they are rade breed. There are extreme results in almost every human endeavor. A tiny number of people have written most of what has been read. A tiny number of people have made most of the scientific accomplishments. A tiny number of people get most of the attention And you are authoritarian socialist? Yes they discovered oil and put it into a sovereign wealth fund, which was used to invest in sectors outside of Norway. These funds are the backbone of Norwegian economy, without these taxes, Norway would have to ease the markets like Finland in order to grow. Yeah pretty much Show me a socialist country which didn\\'t follow the pattern I laid out... No you can\\'t. Socialism on books is a fairytale. Dead people cannot declare bankruptcy. If the estate cannot cover the debt, then the assets are proportionately distributed among the debtors and the inheritors get nothing. That\\'s exactly how it works. If you inherit both assets + debt, then you have to take both together. Inheritance tax will then likely apply on income recieved net debt (i.e. assets - debt). \\n\\nHowever, you cannot choose to take only assets without the debt. It could if you\\'re nowhere mentioned as a liable party that the loan is paid . They can\\'t just add you magically. Read manufacturing consent by Noam Chomsky and Ed Herman. Yes, I\\'m afraid so. And, American education for the masses is garbage and full of the same propaganda that\\'s infesting the major news outlets here. The difference between American \\'news\\' and that of an authoritarian regime is that Americans still believe it to be true and unbiased. Dude when billionaires or millionaires leave they take there money and buissness with them Lol, this is why people say communism is bad, everybody wants to be a leecher. Let others do the work we will get their things for free.\\n\\nEdit: added their I am not against millionaires or smart people. I don\\'t know why you are twisting what I said. \\n\\nI told multi-billionaires should pay more tax, I didn\\'t say they are evil or anything. They just should have to be taxed more. If they are rather willing to leave country than pay a little nore tax the money which will be nothing to them (they are most likely to have more assets than liquid cash earnings every) then yeah good riddance they are sort like British who exploited trillions of dollars worth resources and fled country. And I am saying this not to all billionaires, just to those who would rather run away than pay a couple millions more in tax, including me, I want to pay more tax but can\\'t. \\n\\nIf you earn 10 billions and pay 50% tax on anything above 5 billion, you still have around 6 billions with you. That is 6000 Millionaires worth of money. They did.\\n\\nThey banned internet in many parts of Delhi during the CAA protests. Nobody has change in Bangalore, the city will explode, lol. [deleted] So we should just bend over and accept it. Nice argument you got there. No. Just because I oppose your extremism doesn’t mean I’m on the opposite end of it.\\n\\nYour idea is bullshit because a “free market” cannot exist without government intervention in the first place. Also BTW, capitalism also restricts innovation in a manner, because no corporations are going to invest in research they don’t believe would bring money. How delusional are you. The system which produced the greatest wealth the world has ever seen with drastic reduction in poverty is RiGhT WiNg ideology. Pound sand fucking socialists. Cpsu Any assets would\\'ve to be declared as collateral to the debt? Can\\'t we inherit the rest? \\\\> you cannot choose to take only assets without the debt.\\n\\nAnything in my comment says otherwise? Huh\\n\\nTIL I had an education full of propaganda. But they make their billions from their businesses in India. Moving their business to other country won\\'t work or give them the same margins. No? Why would anyone want to earn more money if it’s going to be taken by someone else at the end? \\n\\nTaxing anyone more is ridiculous. The government getting more money from the people will not solve the problems this country has.\\n\\nThere is no way I will pay more tax to someone with a verifiable track record of being inefficient with taxpayer dollars. Especially not those BMTC conductors with bag full of coins (most of the times). I wonder when BMTC will implement UPI, where you can purchase tickets pre boarding at bus stops, through apps. I agree. I agree with you, I am just against big governments. Government in a regulatory role is sometimes good. Also this guy\\'s account is nuts. The greatest wealth by slaving an entire race? Also China is going to overtake the US this year and the USSR would have had Kruschev not been a filthy revisionist. Sorry about that. Yeah they decide to move when they start gaining severe loses.... What about current 30%? You don\\'t want to pay for that also? It is being taken away from your income now.\\n\\nSo why do you think most people want to earn more after reaching 3L? If you earn anymore than that, a part of it will be taken by govt. How am I going to catch my bus in running then? I invest my money wisely and minimise my tax liability, to as much extent as possible.\\n\\nYou can pay 0 tax easily with an income up to 10 lakhs. I’m pretty sure a good CA can make you pay 0 tax at a much higher income.\\n\\nPeople want to earn more, but they don’t want their money taken by anyone else. ~3% people file their tax returns in India, and 2% out of the 3% do not pay any tax at all. \\n\\nSo yeah, to answer your question, I do not want to pay the 30% current tax either. So you are happy to be a freeloader on 3% people who pay tax and get all the govt stuff for free? Yet cry when we ask for ultra ultra rich people to pay more? '},\n",

Won\\'t it slowly rise back to normal ? Oh ok Account kholna padega , yeh wala pada ,pura padhna tha na. :) Things r uncertain. No one knows how the public will behave after the virus gets over. Not everything is gonna go back to normal. Major restructure needs to happen. After the virus ppl r gonna reassess their losses.  Its gonna crash for sometime then only with gov intervention its gonna rise but it will take a long time to recover. Yes why do you think so Things \"are\" uncertain but after the disease is done (which will gradually happen) during this slow period of time probably 4-5 months might even 3 months with strict actions taken by hotspots in country it will help people recover in areas where covid cases are not that much relatively speaking and hence economy will recover with a slow pace .What I am trying to say is the economy might go down a bit but won\\'t crash again it will hit its low point and will slowly rise and kabboom in 4-5 months (just like the previous bull markets) recover. Please explain your perspective in-depth Thanx Major gov intervention is needed. Every gov needs to work together to recover. Losses r huge coz of lockdown it hasn\\'t come out yet. 4-5 months is very optimistic. I\\'ll give it a year at the minimum.

Yes that's certainly possible. Cross border transactions always have higher compliance norms to follow. Masking ownership not as easy as it once was. I am not talking about cross-border transactions. ...you were talking about Chinese investments into Indian companies. Those are cross border transactions. Cross holdings are not direct investments. At one point, even through layers of cross holdings, the money has to come into India from another country, right? Could be a Chinese company investing through a Mauritian entity. Or even a Chinese company owning a cypriot company owning a Mauritian company who buys a stake in an Indian company. \\n\\nAny money being invested into India (non fiis) has stricter norms, and are cross-border transactions.

[deleted] Worst time to have suicidal thoughts I'm afraid Is this supposed to be a resume lmao I am afraid I am not informed about that. Say what now I am in a college right now (I joined when I was 17). I wanted to take a break from college because I had panic attacks and remembered some horrible shit and I've been in a weird low mood after that. I've always been a bit sad but now I'm worse. I don't want to see my parents for another second. I don't want to look at my sister. I just want out. I want to leave these horrible people Where? ahhh, pyramid scheme Thank you I'm in Chennai I didn't schedule them into my life. Asshole I'm 18 what do you think my resume looks like. It's as clean as the list of the number of people who will fuck you COVID 19 is a hyper-infectious desease that is travelling the World right now. It affects the respiritaroy organs of us humans and makes it hard to breath and can kill. It is really infectious and readily transmits to people you are in close proximityto and even our pets. We are all very worried about it.\\n\\nLots of governments are issuing advice and even orders - that we all stay at home right now and don't go travelling about, all in order to contain the spread of this disease. Hey hey its okay. \\n\\nCan you ask your parents to have you move to a hostel near your college? high school or middle school maybe Lol I know. I MYSELF have suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. But I'm just stating the fact. I'm not trying to sugar-coat or change your mind because I know by experience that it doesn't work. In this competitive market good luck getting a job with those manners, especially when your competition is people with PHDs struggling to get jobs I know about that, I thought he meant that legally I'll have to start with my parents for longer. I'm quarantined with my parents now. Trust me, I have not forgotten about covid-19 I am a hosteller but I don't want to EVER interact with my parents. I don't feel comfortable taking their money, I don't like dealing with them for academic purposes. I just want to be left alone I have not quit from college, yet I understand science pretty well and I've taught many of my classmates but there are much better teachers out there and I don't think anyone would want my help I get it. I appreciate straight talk. But that doesn't mean what you say in the first comment isn't very helpful or insightful Sure, thanks for the luck. I'll shove it up your ass. The age of majority is 18 so you are not legally required to live with your parents or do what they say. Under normal circumstances you could move out and start your own life.\\n\\nConsidering the current lockdown though, I would urge you to wait a while and think on it. I agree with your emotions and also understand your situation. \\n\\nYou only have 2/3 years left of college, amirite? \\n\\nIts a long time ik. Finding jobs in this country is downright difficult being a 12th pass. I'm telling you this because practically funding your own college fees and survive at the same time is impossible. It will definitely mess up your whole future. Ik you dont like how all of this sounding but i see no better way to explain this to you. \\n\\nOnce you graduate, you atleast will be considered when looking for jobs. Its harsh but thats the truth in this country. And i suggest you shouldnt. Continue with it. Finish college. And then with a bit of luck and hard work you will get a job and will get to move out permanently with no strings attached. Take care bro. Jeez I just checked your post history, situation sounds bad, if you are willing you can learn python online for free , if you are good enough you could work in a programming out sourcing company or something I think he means the curfew, police are beating anyone who go outside Yeah India is the killer of dreams. I appreciate the straight talk. Thank you for being polite. I'll think things over 🤞 Thank you Thanks No worries. Hope you find your way in all this mess. \\nTry not fuck up your future by quitting. It'll surely be worth it in the end. \\n\\nThat'll be my 2 cents. Good day to you. Stay safe. \\n\\nPs: you can always pm me if you ever need any advice. Or just need to vent. I'm all ears :) Thank you \"},\n",

Haha.I also remember that this sub was full of praise for Jio. Every single post used to be how awesome Jio is and how Airtel just sucks. It's called introductory prices, and was needed, cause Jio was a new player and barriers to entry are pretty darn high in such industries. we need anti trust laws... wait we are in India not gonna happen FFS\\n\\nSave Airtel pls. Wait come back. Where are you going. Why are you running? Ruk Jaa o dil Deewane Bring some onion on the way back. I was using Vodafone earlier, switched to Jio almost a year ago. TBH Vodafone was the worst I had used, the call drop rates were high, 4G on Vodafone is a joke. Tried my friends Jio-fi for a week, was happy with it, specially the 4G speed, amongst the highest I have experienced. That said, I won't be paying 900 per month. I am already gone to BSNL. Because where I live, Jio is much better than any other network. I get an average internet speed of 30-40Mbps. Why are we still here? i get signal in my apartment with jio only Would have switched to bsnl if there were better connectivity. That works about to ~4.5 per GB.\\n\\n@15 Rs, the charge for 2GB per day for 28 days is Rs 840 PUBG doesn't really take that much data to play. Even 1gb/day plan would be sufficient for it with other browsing needs. Just move to a lower data plan when it happens. Not much options .... 225 rs per month additional isn't a laughing matter I agree, it’s very hard to prove predatory pricing in  antitrust cases anyway. \\n\\nJio actually got the benefit of being a late entrant to the game though, since they were much less leveraged compared to the other players who had invested huge amounts of money in the 2G/3G spectrum. \\n\\nMaybe everyone (consumers, regulators, competition) would’ve been happier if Jio had put a firm deadline on these “introductory” prices? Most of us don't like getting fucked in the ass Every tried Airtel? It works excellent in capital cities at least, don't know about smaller cities. I don't get BSNL 4G coverage. 3g stays there for few seconds then back to 2g. Just to suffer. Yeah. Which carrier offers it at 15 Rs / Gb and not still gone under? Who said I am laughing ? Can't afford move to a lower price plan majority people dont really need 2GB every 24 hour. I am 1.5 GB/day plan and even that is underutilized. I still remember the day when I paid ₹245/GB/month back in college. Maybe my bar is lower than others, but I can afford it until they go back to that level of rates.\\n\\n\\n Its not like you are going to start a new company just because he raised prices. We will have to manage with whatever option we have It works fine almost everywhere. It worked for me even on the fucking Khardungla Pass , although very briefly. I know but I won't give my money to Jio or chortel. I would rather use bullshit than Airtel or Jio shit. I'm not saying you're laughing. And criminals don't deserve understanding. Predatory pricing led to this. He doesn't get to play victim here. \"},\n",

If BSNL collapses and leaves market, there will be so many villages and small cities without any more broadband and 3g/4g internet even. BSNL should be saved at any cost, because they are the backbone of rural internet. BSNL would have had 4G years before Jio if only Govt didn't kneecap it. Such a mess. BSNL is on the verge of collapse now. Just the way government took care of YES Bank by its proactive measures why not they do the same with BSNL too instead of so called strategic disinvestment and all. Jaise ko taisa mila bada maja aayaa. Jio kare toh raasleela To fight the monopoly. Big NO. In that case it won’t be fair to charge for unused data. 95% of my data goes unused.

Spiti valley for example, till 2017 / 18 only had BSNL connectivity, Jio is already up and running there now in 2020. \\n\\nSimilar cases various other parts of the country, Jio has managed to bring it self to match BSNL's network spread in a way that Airtel & Vodafone still haven't been able to Because economics teaches many lessons, but we have learned to socialize losses, and privatize profits. The decision to put a floor cap has already seems to have been decided. The mobile bill will atleast double\\n\\nThe current row is about whether small players like BSNL should be included in that. Lol like they are gonna pass a single benefit to customer\\n\\nThey are gonna squeeze you for last single rupee you have The place where I live, fairly a big town, I have better BSNL network than JIO. and there is no broadband service other than BSNL and Airtel has entered recently. Likewise there are many places BSNL has better service than any other networks. They will lose that too. \"},\n",

Since when we Apple TV here? While I don\\'t support censorship, who will protect the companies when people boycott them? They are legitimate businesses who need to comply with the local regulations, and unfortunately sentiments of the people too. \\n\\nFor example, some third-party seller on Amazon Canada was selling some slippers with Ganesha printed and people here caused massive outrage, left bad reviews for their app on Play store, and it escalated to the extent that Sushma Swaraj tweeted to Jeff Bezos that they will impose sanctions on Amazon operating in India, when the Indian marketplace had nothing to do with what a third-party seller listed on the Canada marketplace.\\n\\nCriticizing streaming services for censorship is easy for us to do, but is a sensitive business critical decision to make for the ones running the business. Clone wars too. Haven\\'t watched that It\\'s at a fraction of the bitrate compared to Disney+.

Isn’t cricket included with Hotstar VIP? These people really need to learn about what the House of Mouse is capable of. They can paralyze the American Senate if they wanted to. Oliver, lol. Lol today you learnt a valuable lesson.. Only movie,show is not availabl. I searched for it in the app ,says nothing found . But too pussy to let an episode criticising Modi stay up. Sometimes the Mouse really acts like one. :) About what ? Yeah, I noticed that. Even Manadalorian is not showing right now. Update ur app to the latest version. On the middle there\\'s disney+ . Tap on that. It\\'ll show. Not searchable while you\\'re on hotstar section. It\\'s not like Bob Iger himself (or, the new guy who will take over from Iger) called up HotStar & asked them to do it. Have you ever heard of this phenomenon where the darbaris are more loyal than kings? \\n\\nSomeone here took that call, and I bet no one in Disney decision making body actually cares about that. India is rampant with self censorship on all sides. \\n\\nIf you think what happens on HotStar with LWT affects Disney\\'s bottomline, can\\'t help you. It\\'s there on hotstar, I just confirmed it now It doesn\\'t show up directly(It shows up under some different categories) They\\'re testing still. Just checked that\\'s gone again. On the middle of the app there\\'s movies section now. Was Disney+ a while back. When I commented after checking the availability. '},\n",

While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. \\n\\nThis pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?\\n\\nBusinesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. \\n\\nRemarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. \\n\\nA critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**\\n\\nStudies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. \\n\\nReal Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.\\n\\n**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**\\n\\n1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.\\n\\n2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.\\n\\n3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   \\n (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.\\n\\n4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.\\n\\n5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.\\n\\nWhile the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: \\n\\n **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. \\n\\n**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.\\n\\n· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**\\n\\n· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.\\n\\n· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. \\n\\n· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.\\n\\n· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.\\n\\n· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own \\n\\n· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \\\\- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!\\n\\n· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \\\\- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \\\\- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!\\n\\n· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.\\n\\n· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.\\n\\n· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.\\n\\n· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.\\n\\n· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.\\n\\n**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**\\n\\nProbably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**\\n\\n1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.\\n\\n2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.\\n\\n3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.\\n\\n4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.\\n\\n5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.\\n\\n6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.\\n\\n7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.\\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** \\n\\n**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**\\n\\n\\\\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, \\n\\n\\\\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, \\n\\n\\\\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly \\n\\n\\\\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... \\n\\nSimply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process\\n\\n**The Bottom Line**\\n\\n**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**\\n\\nReal estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.\\n\\n**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**\\n\\nThoughts Compiled By : \\n\\nDheeraj Kochhar\\n\\nCapitor Ventures Pvt Ltd\\n\\nNavi Mumbai\\n\\nReferences : \\n\\nAnarock Report March 2020, Varsha Rathore, Zricks.com, Pic Credits: Google stories and newspapers\",\n",

Hi good morning, u r right a certain points...but please try to understand real estate is emotional investment...whatever happens need of own house will never die. When u talk to someone and says - Mera apna Ghar...so much pride is there in our talks. So again my view is real estate will never die. ROTI , KAPDA AUR MAKAAN. basics needs . U may beg to differ and u r right. But it's individuals choice. Thanks Yes its moving specially affordable housing. Think of all the thousands of empty apartments in Mumbai lying vacant for years as the builder wasn't able to get anyone to buy them.. and this is before the virus hit.. Affordable housing is approximately how much of the 200crore investment in Mumbai? Hi good morning, u r absolutely correct. But the reason for that is pricing....and location. To sell so many things should be perfect like - size, price, location , amenities, right marketing...so many things. On the other hand some builders are individually selling 1000 flats a month also. Article is about overall scenario. Thanks for writing dear. Approx 50-60cr...that too in last 15 days only and in Mumbai. \"},\n",

Here credit underwriting model uses credit bureau data, Bank statements, Income tax returns.  So, 97% people are not accessed to formal credit. Still they borrow from the loan mafia & they charge exorbitant interest rates. There is need for alternative credit assessment, by using smartphone data & using social security numbers. \\n\\n- The Turn around time for the loans is 7 days to 3 Months. While the world battles issues centering around data privacy and consent, the Account Aggregator & Indian stack will allow both individuals and businesses to share their financial data in digital form with third parties in a safe manner. \\n\\n- Credit Risk - Risky Business \\n \\nPredicting the risk of customer credit default. How to Improve credit risk models by predicting the probability of default on a consumer credit product in the next 18 months. More accurate credit risk evaluations allow issuers of credit to be able to responsibly extend and manage credit lines. \\n\\nUnlike traditional models of underwriting which focus on only a handful of credit attributes, we can analyze thousands of data points from financial & non financial data sources, we can accurately model credit risk for any consumer. By applying advances in machine learning we can able to radically outperform traditional scorecards in both consumer and small business lending. \\n\\nBy building models on more than simple default, and focusing on such outcomes as profitability and customer lifetime value, we allow you to fully leverage artificial intelligence to increase your lending performance. \\n\\n- Ample computing power and digital data are the fuel for machine learning, of course. The more data and the more iterations the algorithmic engine goes through, the better its output gets. Data scientists come up with probabilistic prediction models for specific actions, and then the algorithm churns through loads of data to produce better decisions in real time with every iteration. These prediction models become the basis for most business decisions.\\n\\n- we applied for Account aggregator license from Reserve bank of India, we get all public data like Banking, Mutual funds, insurance etc. we are in the process building the consortium to share non financial data.\\n\\n- By Automating the entire process &  building the algorithms using supervised learning, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, Experimenting & building software stack. I hope we can solve this problem. \\n\\n- current credit bureau has many flaws like their algorithm is  blatantly opaque, they don’t use real time data, their business model itself skeptical. \\n\\n- So, we want to start a platform which can adds value to the both lenders & borrowers.\\n\\n- We are looking for AI, ML engineers, data scientists who can build probabilistic models, blockchain enthusiasts,Front end designers for building the application & app.\\n\\n\\nOur doors are always open for founders who have moved on\\n\\nWe understand that most of the founders are generalists and we won't evaluate you for a specialist position.\\n\\nWe love who keep pushing against the slope, so lets talk if we can build  together.\\n\\nCulture :- \\n\\nRemote Work: We have a remote working culture, meaning our employees can work wherever they want around the world as long as the job gets done.\\n\\nFlexible working hours: We empower our team with personal autonomy on team projects. We have an unlimited vacation policy and flexible working hours. That means you have to be self-directed and self-motivated to succeed.\\n\\nStock Options: We're all working towards the same goal, so it's only fair that everyone is invested in the success of their work\\n\\nIf that seems awesome and if you like the idea of building values with us -- Build trust, Question assumptions, and Validate direction -- you'll fit right in.\",\n",

       "  'comments': \"Aren't there a number of mobile apps that already provide instant loans? Although they charge a huge interest rate with a short loan period. I will give one example to you, Before Airbnb, travelers had little choice but to pay high prices for a hotel room, and property owners couldn’t easily and reliably rent out their unoccupied space. \\n\\nAirbnb saw untapped supply and unaddressed demand where others saw nothing at all. The same is true of private car services Lyft and Uber. \\n\\nFew people imagined that it was possible to build a billion-dollar business by simply connecting people who want to go places with people willing to drive them there. \\n\\nWe already had state- licensed taxicabs like Meru & fasttrack etc and private limousines, only by believing in and looking for secrets could you see beyond the convention to an opportunity hidden in plain sight. \\n\\nThe same reason that so many internet companies, including Facebook, are often underestimated their very simplicity is itself an argument for secrets. \\n\\nIf insights that look so elementary in retrospect can support important and valuable businesses, there must remain many great companies still to start.\\n\\nYou can’t find secrets without looking for them.we want to change the future of credit. \\n\\nIf you think something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief in secrets is an effective truth.\\n\\nThe actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers. Like you & me, who are creating cult. \\n\\nEVERY ONE OF TODAY’S most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown and unsuspected. The mathematical relationship between a triangle’s sides, for example, was secret for millennia. Pythagoras had to think hard to discover it. If you wanted in on Pythagoras’s new discovery, joining his strange vegetarian cult was the best way to learn about it. Today, his geometry has become a convention a simple truth we teach to grade schoolers.\\n\\n3 billion humans cannot access basic credit services and fewer than 9% of citizens in developing economies have ever taken a loan from a financial institution.\\n\\nIn many economies, generations of people are governed by a dark underworld of illegal lending\\u200a a pseudo-economy ran by gangsters and fraudsters. For these 3 billion people, the idea of accessing enough credit to buy a home or start a business is a pipe dream.\\n\\nThe credit problem is a fundamentally interesting one because it involves a market that is incredibly unequal and blatantly opaque. Despite the fact that these inefficiencies squander the potential of billions, nobody questions the status quo of credit. In a world of globalization, the credit industry is far from global.\\n\\n\\nIn countries rich and poor, access to credit is a fundamental cornerstone of social mobility. No matter your age, gender, language or nation, credit is the key driving force to boosting prosperity. From a newlywed couple looking to settle down and buy their first home, to an aspiring entrepreneur looking to start a small business, virtually every human on the planet depends on credit. It is the gateway to financial inclusion and ultimately financial freedom.\\n\\nThat's our company secret! I'm not sure of the rules in India, but banks in the US (I work for one) are only allowed to use specific information for the loan-approval process.\\nData points like gender, age etc. are a strict no-no as you could be accused of being biased, despite the fact that your model is better at predicting defaults given these inputs as well.\\nAnother concern of mine is regarding the use of AI/ML models. Since these are essentially black boxes, justifying how the model works is next to impossible. You can explore techniques like PD-LGD-EAD modeling. I'm not too informed about the Indian banking situation, perhaps someone else could shed some light. Hey, you are going to have to compete with companies like credit karma from US and our very own credit mantri and even to some level bankbazar. Go through them first and understand what you can offer what they dont. Our team have prior experience in working with Credit bureaus, alternative credit assessment companies, loan aggregators. We are doing beyond that, that algorithms are normal already used by all major credit bureaus. We can discuss in direct message. \"},\n",

It has become a wealth destroyer. 90% allure towards Vodafone is because of those mind blowingly good concepts for Ads Who gets ZooZoo\\'s IP.. mnukesh ambani khareedega automatic ho jaayega You are right do it first thing in the morning. Yes BSNL failure wasn\\'t about professional management. It\\'s politicians who screwed it. yup. it\\'s unlikely that airtel and jio can handle the load of the entire customer base of vodafone idea limited if shit hits the fan. this is assuming government would want to resell all the spectrum currently with VIL because that\\'s how they like to do it right? > The worst thing is that these bastards killed BSNL\\n\\nThey could have been 1-2 years early on 4G space relative to Jio. Like China did its 3 Telecom operators, make national champions and allow them a fighting chance going forward.  \\nNow a significant chunk of resources (time, capital and human) will be required to keep BSNL afloat and help them whereas they could have led this revolution and everyone would have been better off once Private players would have provided competition so no one relaxed. \\n\\nWhat a mess. Private players can\\'t do well. Public players can\\'t do well. What the heck works here exactly. Just wait till you only have two options left so they can now basically do whatever they want. They\\'re no longer hungry because you\\'ll come to them. They no longer have to fight because there\\'s enough for both. They will just be stronger than the other in 50% of the areas and theyll still have 17% more market share than today. Prices were hiked by 40% recently and their leaders said that it\\'s still not viable. BJP is not the only party to blame here. This issue has been festering for well over a decade. Jesh. Awesome sources... They are right there, where the shit happens! The Supreme Court ruling is for a 14 year old case\\n\\nhttps://www.bloombergquint.com/business/supreme-court-asks-telecom-operators-to-pay-rs-92000-crore-dues\\n\\n>>The verdict ends the 14-year-old legal battle between mobile operators and the government on the definition of adjusted gross revenue—used to calculate spectrum charges and licence fees. The Department of Telecommunications had sought more than Rs 92,000 crore in dues. The exact amount, however, may change based on what’s finally included in the definition.\\n\\nThis is a few months old article but good explanation If you read the article,  it says they were supposed to be paid by Jan 27 and still hadnt been paid. Its overdue and not a new bill they are given so they had ample time to arrange for the money. When was the case filed ? Umm what?  \\nDid you happen to read/follow the entire case  or just plain headlines? Jio already paid their dues before the deadline > retroactive tax\\n\\nRetroactive tax case has nothing to do this AGR case. Pranab has no role in AGR. Two cases are different. Nice meme material right there Arun Mishra BJP stooge > The bench wanted that the order passed by the desk officer should be withdrawn immediately otherwise \"he (desk officer) will be sent to the jail in the evening today\".\\n\\nJustice Arun Mishra has done it before too: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/senior-advocates-urge-justice-arun-mishra-to-be-patient-with-lawyers-judge-apologises-1625358-2019-12-05 maybe only when he doesn\\'t get the head They used it for Inter-company connection.\\n\\nThe money \"owed\" is more than the market cap of both companies several times over.\\n\\nSMH. Jios dues were 195 crores, a mere 0.2% of the amount owed by Airtel and Voda. Jio deposited that money by taking loan from govt. They were done by Ogilvy. They\\'re just really good at their stuff. They have also given BJP their 2014 and 2019 campaigns, while coining the slogan - abki baar modi sarkar. Imagine the impact that one firm has had on this country. Jio ya maro. Agreed. But there were genuine issues with the staff. Also, the top management were babus. Even promoting engineers would have helped it get an edge. That is what  my relatives who retired recently from the company say. Ever been to a BSNL office? Entering that office feels like you’ve stepped two decades into the past. Professional management there was shit. There’s no better way to put it.\\n\\nThey were my ISP for 3 years and god forbid if my internet somehow stopped working due to their fault. Motherfuckers they all are! Lazy government employees who don’t even want to move an inch and eat a good salary with insurance, low tax schemes and pension type of motherfuckers.\\n\\nFuck BSNL. I’ve had some worst time of my life begging these babus to fix my internet that they broke. Still gets me mad! BSNL was professionally screwed. I already get lower than 1Mbps during peak hours on Jio in my area. It\\'s been like this since forever. You can\\'t pull 50000 crores out of your ass. Even if given a few months. You do realize it is doesn\\'t make any sense, right? If it did make sense then GAIL wouldn\\'t owe 1.72 lakh crores or Power Grid 22000 crores? They have almost zero telecom business but that\\'s the fees being demanded by the government because an interpretation of a definition says that the government has access to 8% of their entire revenue?\\n\\nDo you realize that only 3 private players are left? One of them is continously going down the shitter and is on the verge of closure? That means job losses, that means vendors will go unpaid, bank loans will default, crisis will get accelerated. Even the bloody government doesn\\'t want just two players and they have expressly said so in public. \\n\\nDo you realize how much money the telecom industry already pays? Other than the fact that India has the most expensive spectrum and the cheapest rates in the world - even just laying down regular fiber requires to connect the country, extremely poorly by the way, costs an arm and a leg. Laying down just 1.5 kilometres of fiber costs almost 1-2 Cr in fees to the government, in most part of the metros. Many times even just crossing the road with fiber to connect the other side means over 50 lakhs of fees for the government and nothing else. Just fees. And on top of this, it\\'s all connected poorly because our government doesn\\'t even provide ducts below roads like many other countries. When is the amount being paid enough? Its literally the most expensive in the world. Fyi BSNL doesn\\'t even have to pay these fees cos they\\'re a PSU and they\\'re still shit! \\n\\nWhat reasonable company will keep provisions of 50000 crores? If they have that kind of money they\\'ll invest it in the bloody business and try to grow.\\n\\nAll of this because of a bloody interpretation of the definition of a clause. 2005 I think. Care to elaborate on what part of the comment for say that? I\\'m saying jio will buyout Vodafone idea by paying Vodafone ideas agr dues effectively creating a duopoly. True I will take back my comment. Could have explained a little more\\n\\nBoth cases, one merger case specifically against voda  and second case of licesing defination fiasco are from his era ,in this everyone is paying. Together these two sucked vodaphone dry.\\n\\n Personally I feel vodaphone is one of the few companies which got treated like shit in our market due to such laws. Shhh. Don\\'t tell him. Of course! Why am i not surprised. Sad part is that they don\\'t need to have a license for inter company connections. They could\\'ve very very easily just bought the connections from Airtel, TCL, Voda, Sify, etc which is a what 99.99999% of the companies do. Jio dues were 195 crores only. Doesnt really matter how they paid it. Maaro data is secondary. vodafone idea was literally the largest network in india at the time of merger. jio overtook them recently. but the number is so large that it would pretty much saturate airtel/jio infrastructure. would be hard to make calls. and this could potentially happen in next 30 days. just like what happened when rcom decided to shut down and gave only a month for customers to port out. \\n\\n(also... do remember that PSUs also owe a lot of money to the government because they hold telecom licenses but are not using them. 3 lakh crores)\\n\\n[PSUs may move Supreme Court over Rs 3 lakh crore telecom dues - The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/india-demands-2-1-billion-telecom-dues-from-fertilizer-maker/articleshow/73065551.cms?from=mdr) That didnt seem to be an issue when buying the spectrum so cut your crap that they didn\\'t have enough time. In short, it\\'s Jio all the way now. The amount and date of payment came with the final SC order after years of litigation. The telcos were waiting for a miraculous government intervention that din\\'t happen.  \\n  \\nAs a matter of fact, both Airtel and Vodafone provisioned the losses in their balance sheet during the last quarter itself despite their ability/inability to pay.  \\n  \\nSo no, it wasn\\'t as if this came as a lighting bolt to them. Why would they pay the dues when cost of acquiring customers in a duopoly is low? And considering Airtel is semi-fucked too, this is a wet dream for Jio. Please do tell ! nahi to pura kaise hoga mera adha gyaan🙏 Idiotic decision by the government to squeeze the private sector and destroy a government institution\\n, just as we\\'re about to recover. Taking loan from Govt and paying it to the govt. Yes and they took out loans which they got because spectrum is a capital asset. Nobody is going to give them loans to pay fines. If it\\'s that black and white, why do GAIL and Power Grid owe 1.72 lakh crores and 22000 crores respectively even though they didn\\'t even use the license. They are taxing non telecom revenue. Read up on the issue. A. Just because they made provisions in the P&L doesn\\'t mean they have the cash. It means that they\\'re showing it as a loss but they\\'re not showing where it\\'ll come from. That aspect of the money will come from the cash flow statement. The provision in the P&L just means that yes we acknowledge that this is a loss but it doesn\\'t guarantee payment. \\n\\nB. No amount of intimation can prepare a company for an amount this high especially when the industry has willingly bled itself for almost 3 years. Simple fact is and its common sense too - if they had this much money lying around, they would invest it to grow the money so much that they can pay off the debt and also make some money from it. \\nIt is a hurculean amount. Entire industries are worth that much. It is a significant percentage of the national GDP. \\n\\nC. Great so they weren\\'t prepared to pay this amount which entirely hinged on the interpretation of a definition of a clause. What now? Their shop gets shut. That\\'s business. Bye bye jobs bye bye economy fuck the industry fuck the consumer - all over an interpretation of a definition.\\n\\nThis is what defeat looks like. This is where Voda will cut the losses and leave. Theres no other way left for them. Exactly. Especially when there is a credit crunch and now that their share price is crashing, raising money through equity is also not possible. \\n\\nThe only options left are, if the promoters pump fresh equity - which seems unlikely since they\\'ve said so themselves. Or if they file for bankruptcy. I am not debating the issue on the tax. I am just stating that this is not an on the fly notice and that there was plenty time to arrange for payment. *Shaam ko bolte hai ki raat tak 50000 crore jama karo.*  \\n  \\nI just replied to that .  \\nMate, are you arguing just for the sake of it ?  \\n  \\nAll your points are valid but pray tell me how\\'s is this anyone else\\'s fault except the telcos ? Nobody forced them to get into the market or pull out of it.  \\n  \\nThere are multiple recourses available including bailoff, merger, insolvency, bankruptcy, buyout etc  \\nLet the law take it\\'s course or unless you don\\'t believe in that kinda thing. This won\\'t be the first time in history a company goes down and surely it won\\'t be the last. No company is too big to fail.\\n  \\nLastly, it is not the obligation of the government to help out private sector entities in an economy like ours. \\n  \\nP.S. Airtel is expected to manage through and if VI doesn\\'t that\\'s just the cost of doing business like numerous others before. How does one arrange for 50000 crores? Halwa hai Kya? Who will give you that money knowing well that it is going to go straight to the government and not into the business, so the odds of seeing it come back especially with returns are slim No one has to. Vodafone will exit. And Jio and Airtel will enjoy fruits of duopoly. '},\n",

People aren't purchasing enough shit rn Winners don't quit and you shouldn't either! The extra 6% will go some way in directly filling up the exchequer's pocket. If people buy more phones, then also some amount goes back to the government, but in the long run. They need money in the short run, like right now.

Every single bank branch of every bank has to physically move the excess cash ( from the branch alloted level) to it's currency chest ( think of it as a rbi repository).\\n\\n2. For the above, counting of cash happens at various levels each day . A person physical verifies all the values with the counting machines and system values.\\n\\n3. Security at the currency chest (where the bank's physical cash is stored) , which is bomb proof with zero power cuts 24/7 365 days a year. \\n\\nSo you have no clue the money bank's spend to ensure physical cash is managed properly.\\n\\nAll private banks have cash deposit charges over a certain limit every month, to reduce physical cash movement.\\n\\nBanks have invested like insanely money on online banking facilities because physical branches cost a fuckton of money. \\n\\nSo it's fucking god's gift to bank when people move towards virtual banking as compared to physical movement of money. \\n\\nSo why then banks chose to increase charges for upi ?\\n\\nCrony Capitalism states that  revenue never decreases. So while bank saves shitton of money , it doesn't count for stock market and revenue must keep increasing. So they have to find new ways of charging people. \\n\\nThey will increase the cost of upi , they will charge for cash deposits also , they wil charge you for atm .As long as most banks do it , they feel safe. \\n\\nSo it's a false notion that the money invested for upi has to be recovered from upi transactions only. To bc they are also trying to force you to not use cash. Why I will pay even a single rupee extra for evey single transaction? No. Freemium is not the right word. Banks be like: We save a lot of manpower/cost by automating and turning digital. Lets give the notion that it actually *increases* the cost and charge people for the convenience. I agree for eg when citibank went to shit in US, to save it, what you state where some of the steps,\\nbranchless banking more like fucking saving us money\\noh and they also capped the CEO' s salary etc, but yes branchless banking was a big cost saver Also don't forget they charge for cash withdrawals too, after just 4 transactions in a month. \"},\n",

They're also supposed to give you back the Rs. 10,000 application fees that you pay to the bank. Now, I don't think I got this amount directly to my bank account. Maybe they worked something out with the bank. There were a lot of transactions happening for that loan, so I couldn't find anything from WMS. \\n\\nAnyways, WeMakeScholars does not charge you anything. Anything charged by the bank is completely different. But you can contact WMS who kind of acts like your advocate. You can ask them questions and they can contact the bank and let you know. There was a time when they even reduced the timeline by a bit because I had to leave soon Great! Thanks for the feedback! \"},\n",

Second, if someone has dollars and access to the US stockmarket, asking them to invest in the indian stockmarket where EVERY company is engaged in some level of fraud is very very bad advice. Well from my perspective: $300,000 USD is a considerable sum, but since I have the ability to permanently shift to India (thanks to my OCI card), I might as well convert that considerable sum into Rupees where it would translate into roughly 2 crore, and live out the rest of my life investing that 2crore so that it may produce monthly cash flow. \\n\\nIn theory, it\\'s a way to achieve financial independence. 2 crores in India is far better than $300,000 USD in the U.S.A; there\\'s a lot more I could do with the money in India than in the U.S.A.

Inflation in india is through the roof despite what the government figures suggest. Leave that money in the states and invest in the S&P, not the shit-tier indian stock markets. Even with currency conversion fees, you\\'ll come out ahead. Most here have ZERO understanding of these things and will tell you in \"invest\" in indian real estate or other such rubbish like that. You have money in the world\\'s reserve currency. Why convert to shitcoin? Your bank account will be blocked if it receives so much money, you have to run from pillar to post to get it unblocked, have you got aadhaar scam card, have you taken approval from RBI? one fine morning, chaddichandan may run away from India, taking all money from your Indian bank, once the bank goes bankrupt, you will get nothing.\\n\\nMove 30% wealth to bitcoin/other crypto currencies rest hold in USD Even if I weren\\'t to invest, I could probably retire on 2 crores. I don\\'t plan to have a family. \\n\\nAnd this point about inflation; are you saying that there is no monetary benefit if I convert that sum 10 years from now? I understand that inflation degrades the value of money, but it would still be considerably better to convert right? That converted value would still allow me to do way more than what I could\\'ve done with it in the U.S, right? > Move 30% wealth to bitcoin/other crypto currencies rest hold in USD\\n\\nDO NOT PUT ANY MONEY IN THESE SHITCOINS Don\\'t listen to this guy OP.

Unless you\\'re living in some rural backwater, India is not as cheap as reddit will have you believe and trust me, 2 crores is not a lot of money. It\\'s not 1980 any more.\\n\\nAlso, you seem to ignore how much inflation will erode your purchasing power if you convert your money to rupees.\\n\\n>but it would still be considerably better to convert right\\n\\nIf you have dollars, in almost no situation is it better to convert to rupees. This is why i keep calling the INR shitcoin because it is a poor store of value. If you\\'re in the US, get a fee-only wealth manager.

Were i wrong and you right, the millions of indians who foolishly store their wealth in gold and not an actual investment would disagree with me.\\n\\nGuess what? They don\\'t. 2 crores is under a decades\\' worth of salary for most competent people here.\\n\\nAlso, the value of your money has halved in the last ten years, were you aware of that?\\n\\nBefore you go around calling realists \"losers\" go take a good long hard look at the country you live in. I have and i\\'m well aware that it is a shithole. so I\\'m just supposed to post my question in the comment section? People aren\\'t really replying to any of these comment-based questions, why would they reply to mine? here\\'s some facts for you. India\\'s average inflation rate (except per the very competent indian government) over the past decade was around 6%. At that rate, the value of your money would have nearly halved. Which source of investment in india will be able to keep pace with 6% annual returns? The indian stock market is unreliable and rife with cooked books, bank interest rates are barely above inflation. I could go on.\\n\\nTrust me when i say that the vast majority of people on this sub have no idea what theyr\\'e talking about when it comes to investing.

       "  'comments': 'Waiting for the day when mobs will get angry at these guys and shout slogans outside their houses instead of wanting the blood of someone who might have said something that didn\\'t fit the \\'majority\\' narrative. Or caught transporting cows to his dairy farm. Or said Jai to the wrong country as part of her speech. \\n\\n Maybe the junior finance minister could lead them with his tested model. To Subhash Chandra\\'s credit he is paying back after selling his personal assets. He has the connections and clout to do what other ex-billionaires have done in the past, but in so far, could not be more proud of the guy - the way he is handling business loss. That will never happen as long as there\\'s religion and fanatics in power. People are being kept away from actual crises and made to hate on each other, while the chutiya duo go on a selling spree.\\n\\n\"Main desh nahi bikne dunga\" Behen ka loda khud sab bech raha hain! See in free market some businesses fail. And there will always be people with malicious intentions. In yes bank\\'s case, they bet on many such businesses and it didn\\'t pay off. It would have been one of the most successful banks in Asia if these bets paid off and we would have been hailing its success story. They took too much risk and some bad management and egoistic people at top is the reason of its failure. This has nothing to do with cow, jai hind or \\'majority\\' narrative. \\n\\nI cannot understand why your comment has so many upvotes as it adds nothing to the discussion instead of saying \"India bad duhhh\". And no, mob should not get angry and shout slogans at every businessman who took risks and failed. Two wrongs don\\'t make it right, it simply multiplies the wrongs. That is going backwards to our tribal mentality lol. Courts will try them and convict them if found guilty as they are not allowed to leave country like some did in the past. And Chandra is also committed to paying his debts unlike Ambani. That\\'s how he became \"ex\"-billionaire in the first place. But your comment is so out of point I can see why you may fail mention that. I want you and people who upvoted your comment to argue with me constructively, how any of these is related to cow or jai hind or some government narrative. Thanks Maybe the opposition could lead people there. But no, our opposition is useless.\\n\\nKejriwal in his initial days could be the one to lead an agitation Yes he is slowly paying all of his debts. I don\\'t know why noone mentioned it and started talking about religion lol Because it is called crony capitalism and has a direct , real impact on our lives unlike calling every muslim a traitor who should be shot down.  It is systematically shifting public money to a small bunch of elites. \\n\\n *And no, mob should not get angry and shout slogans at every businessman who took risks and failed*\\n\\nSounds cute but not as heroic as you want to to be.\\n\\nI\\'m angry because there are long lines outside YES bank with grown ups crying at the prospect of their entire life savings being wiped out because \\'someone took a risk and failed\\'.  Of having to justify why they need to withdraw more than the 50,000 of their own money. \\n\\nTo me,  they are the real anti nationals and traitors and not some poor muslim in Delhi or a teenager in Karnataka. TiL India still has an opposition.\\n\\nThe fuck is wrong with congress and allies? Amit shah probably got some shit load of dirt on them to keep their mouths shut What\\'s his share of debts as someone like say Anil Ambani?\\n\\nIs he going to pay back his 12000 crores? Or shall we all pay it off for him while he sips martinis in his penthouse?\\n\\nWill modi government enforce political will to attach his assets?\\n\\nI hope there\\'s nothing religious about my comment. First of all, I\\'m glad that you replied. So thanks for that. But you are again mixing up two entirely separate things because that is what gets upvotes here apparently. You dodged my question as to how any of these is related to what is going on in the country. Instead you doubled down on it lol. Are you saying that this crisis would have been avoided if some poor Muslim in Delhi or a teenager in Karnataka was not treated badly? See I hate BJP antics of creating religious divide when we are ready to move past it, but yes bank failure is in no way related to that. So why are we talking about it on this thread? Can you answer this? \\n\\n\\nDo I think RBI should have acted six months back after the NPA crisis and Yes bank\\'s exposure to failing non banking sector. Absolutely yes. It was their fault thinking that new CEO will somehow fix all the problems and they won\\'t have to intervene. (I\\'m not sure if you have any knowledge of the actual crisis. Let me know if you want to discuss more). All I\\'m saying is this is a financial failure. It has nothing to do with Hindu Muslim or nationalism. Should the government and finance ministry be held accountable? Again, Yes. But if we go to them with the arguments that you are providing, it becomes so  pointless any local BJP leader will debunk it and move on. Hope I made myself clear. Have a great day! What he is trying to say is that we as citizens are distracted by all this Hindu Muslim Pakistan nonsense which has ABSOLUTELY zero impact on our lives.\\n\\nWe need to hold accountable the governments and people responsible. Media should be conducting debates on these issues... Rising costs of NPAs and security of our savings in banks. Also hold accountable the corporations responsible for this mess and attach their assets.\\n\\nNone of this is happening. \\n\\nBut rubbish like Hindu Muslim Pakistan is all the rage with everyone. I don\\'t think he is saying that at all because he is doing the exact opposite in this case\\nHe is talking about hindu Muslims in this thread while this issue should be looked at purely from economics perspective.

Does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLet's assume your HRA component is 3 lakhs. At the start of the financial year/ whenever you join a new company, you need to declare what you expect to pay as rent. For example, you may say your rent is 20000 \\\\* 12 months = 2.4 lakhs. \\n\\nThe company will pay you the entire HRA amount every month (3 lakh/ 12 months = 25000/ per month.) But since you declared rent of 20k only the company will consider only 20k as tax exempt and the will deduct tax on the remaining 5k.\\n\\n(There are some other rules around how much HRA is tax exempt, google it to know more.)\\n\\nIf you declare that you pay no rent, you will get 25k minus whatever tax slab you fall in.\\n\\nIf you declare your rent as exactly 25k, you will get the whole amount. But near the end of the financial year, your company will ask for proof of rent. You will need to submit rent receipts signed by your landlord along with his PAN number. If you do manage submit the receipts, then everything is great. \\n\\nIf you don't the company will consider your entire HRA component as taxable, and deduct tax from that month's salary in one go. Which is why it is better to be as realistic/ truthful as possible, else you might find yourself getting a fraction of your salary during the last month of the FY.\\n\\nSo to answer your question, the HRA money is paid to you, the only thing is how much tax is deducted before it is paid out.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Do I have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI assume that the 'special allowance' you refer to is is the component over and above your basic + HRA. If yes, then you don't need to do anything to claim it. It will be paid to you every month minus tax.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>How do I claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNot sure what you mean by vehicle allowance. \\n\\nIf by internet allowance you mean the telephone reimbursement then the process is this - every month/ quarter, your company will ask you to submit your telephone bills. If you do submit the bills, you will get the reimbursement along with your salary - this is tax exempt till the amount of bills you submit. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you don't submit any bills, you will get the amount as a lumpsum at the end of the year, minus tax. (this is what I've usually seen) IMO, Indian companies break-up salaries into different components in order to:\\n\\n\\n1- compute taxes easily, and \\n\\n2- to minimise some costs like PF, gratuity, etc. \\n\\nSince u/georgecostanza9 has already explained point 1 in detail, I’ll explain the second.\\n\\nThe Indian Provident Fund (PF) rules dictate that *12%* of your *Basic Pay* will be deducted and paid into a sort of account maintained by the government. This money currently earns an interest of about 7% (down from over 8% last year).\\n\\nIn addition to your 12%, the company also is required to contribute an equal/equivalent amount, which is also deposited with the government as part of your PF. This component may be detailed in your salary as 'Employer‘s PF contribution'. Note: This so called contribution from your employer will not be paid to you, and should therefore not be included in computing the amount you’d receive at the end of the month.\\n\\nNow, in order to pay a smaller 'Employer’s Contribution', companies tend to offer a smaller salary component called 'Base Salary/Pay'. \\n\\nIf the other ‘allowances' were to be included as part of one inclusive salary package, both yours’ and the company’s 12% PF deduction/contribution would e higher. For a simpler calculation... If your salary is above 20L then you get between 20-25% deducted as tax and other prerequisites.. So about 75-80% will come as in hand every month... From the tax components... You need to put it in various schemes and et all to save on tax... So that's a hassle i dont think a new person wants to get into esp since the 1.5 lakh limit gets very easily exhausted and the HRA exempt is on actuals... So unless you have a home loan on your account.. You dont have much you can do there\\nOn the 75% ish you get in hand..  Will be what you get paid and is post tax..  So if you are getting paid X annually..  A simplest tool is to do (X/12)*75% as your actual in hand salary... On the conservative side\\nLet me know if you need any help with the specifics Not so easy bro. There is a limit to the maximum tax free rent you can claim.\\n\\nThe actual HRA offered, in all probability, will be the lowest of the following three provisions:\\n\\nThe actual rent that is paid should be less than 10% of the basic salary.\\n\\nIn case you’re staying in a metro, 50% of the basic salary and 40% if you live in a a non-metro city.\\n\\nThe actual amount received as the HRA from the employer.\\n\\nIn most cases it will be hra - 10% of basic. Thank you so much for that. Really appreciate taking the time to write that. That helps a lot! Thank you, I wondered about PF as well and thats good to know. Its good to be aware of how that usually works. Its kind of similar to 401k but looks like it maybe fixed at 12% where as it varies for 401k depending on the employer. Thanks. I was roughly doing (X/12) \\\\* 66% but if I get more than that then even better. I am also planning to get a home loan at some point so hoping that helps as well. 12% is the legal mandate, but you can always opt to deposit more than 12% of the basic pay into the PF account.\\n\\nIrrespective of how much more you decide to set aside for the PF, the company‘s contribution will always be the minimum amount required by law.\\n\\nNote: any amount deposited into your PF account is exempt from income tax.\\n\\nEdit: forgot to explain the gratuity. This is a certain percentage of your Basic Salary that will be paid directly by the company only after you complete a minimum of 5 years of service at the same company in India.\\nThis will not be part of your monthly pay. It will be paid only when you leave the company provided you’ve served a minimum of 5 years. Yes human loan principals done add much since they just get added to the 1.5 lakh exemption which clubs a ton of shit.. So that gets exhausted very fast... Howevet you do get a upto 2 lakh exemption in the interest component.. So that does help.... Good to know about the gratuity as well. Thank you! \"},\n",

Jeff Bezos is the richest person in the history of humanity and is looking to get even richer. Managing to monopolise e-commerce in India will increase his net-worth exponentially.\\n\\nBoth 1. and 2. can be true at the same time. Arguably, 2 will probably outlive 1. While we can acknowledge Amazon for providing a vital infrastructure that out state has simply failed to provide without private means, that\\'s no reason to do puja of bezos.  \\n\\nI recently ordered Achaar from Amazon. later i received the call from the seller. It was a lady, who said she was a seller from rohtak and that her mom was preparing the achaar and hoped that we would love it.\\n\\nNow i am ordering achaar from rohtak sitting in Hyderabad. A lady sitting in rohtak is able to start her own business and find sellers across India. Now amazon is not perfect and it may have hundred of issues. but small things like this make me believe they are making a positive change. Can the current govt say they are doing the same? Out of all shows Bezos mentioned Mirzapur, so he must have watched it.\\n\\n[What was his reaction to the haters?](https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.163/dzq.d7b.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/13-600x263.png) Shop keepers can go duck themselves.    \\nHeck with the bargaining and haggling with the retailers. Amazon has never disappointed me with their service and delivery, and I have been buying stuffs from them ever since they entered India. Their customer support is simply terrific. lot of small shopkeepers don’t get sale due to amazon but the question is if it is correct or wrong nobody can answer but as a consumer it always benefit if they get product at small price than shop also many items I don’t get from small shop I see and buy from amazon so it is beneficial for consumers Jeff has a Monopoly but it\\'s really good. I currently live in the US and Amazon as a platform scares me with its scale. It is like a parallel government with huge sophisticated systems of delivery that push their workers to the extreme.\\n\\nIt is fascinating, no doubt - and it wouldn\\'t be this successful if it wasn\\'t good for both the consumers and the sellers - but it is a monopoly. It should have been broken down years ago into smaller companies but I am assuming that it is now too big to do that. [removed] What they forgot to mention is the millions of jobs lost due to their steep discounts. I don’t understand how Amazon is good for India, they claim to spend 1billion and in the end they will profit 10billion and steal from the economy. Simple math why anyone does business. I wanted to use flipkart since it was somewhat more indian, and as a good competitor to Amazon to avoid monopoly. But alas, flipkart has always been the post office type competitor to the premium banking that is amazon. Soon Amazon themselves will start selling achaar and pappad under Amazon brand and that lady will be out of business .\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately ,This is the issue with Amazon that once they see a certain product is selling well they start their own line up. My friends and I recently made a product. We handled the tech part, sourced some parts from Bangalore, some from Jaipur, some from China. \\n\\nInitially planned to sell via our site but on Amazon, we keep getting sales without even doing anything. Not a whole lot (have just one SKU) but enough to give us confidence in the product\\'s viability. \\n\\nAll three of us have full-time jobs. We do this on the side while living in different cities. Amazon handles all shipping and handling. \\n\\nNot saying that Amazon isn\\'t without flaws, but it also offers some fantastic opportunities Just because this lady is selling her pickle on Amazon **doesn\\'t mean she is selling pickle because of Amazon**. There are a dozen other options to sell it online.\\n\\nHeard of Lijjat papad, or dozen other cooperatives supporting smalls businesses all over India. Even something more commercial like masala monk has such products listed.\\n\\n> Now amazon is not perfect and it may have hundred of issues. but small things like this make me believe they are making a positive change. Can the current govt say they are doing the same?\\n\\nAre you seriously suggesting a company like Amazon is bringing more positive change than the government? Do note that you discounted all the issues Amazon has, so we are simply going to discount all the fuckery both govt. and Amazon have done. Net of that, you think Amazon has improved lives more than govt?\\n\\n>It was a lady, who said she was a seller from rohtak and that her mom was preparing the achaar and hoped that we would love it.\\n\\nSounds like a sob story or a sales pitch. Based on product width looks like a mid sized operation. If I were selling pickles I too would find it convenient telling people that its my mom making pickles in the kitchen.\\n\\nAmazon has destroyed more entrepreneurs than it has created. lets not say they have made a bigger positive change than anyone really A lot of people just list their products on Amazon/Flipkart to market their brand. It\\'s wonderful. People who stay on Amazon, they get good pickup services as far as selling is concerned. Flipkart on the other hand, is pathetic in this department. Can you link me to that Aachar page on Amazon? Can you provide a link to the Achaar? Mate you can\\'t just say that and not slide over the link. Shall I DM!? what about the achaar sellers in Hyderabad man... not to mention the acute achaar shortage in rohtak now I thought sellers can\\'t contact  buyers. Was it prime or fba r/yesyesyesno If you believe Bezos wrote that letter, I have a bridge to sell you. They will sell at MRP and never give discount. My kirana wala sends both his kids to international schools more expensive than what i send my kids to. and i bet he does not earn enough to be taxed either. \\n\\nSo i have no sympathy for them. Dmart is an indian company and on the whole is cheaper than amazon. Makes you wonder what sort of margins may be there in FMCG. Shopkeepers don\\'t have a trillion dollar company that pays 0 taxes in thier own country , or a bunch of investors who keep throwing money at them. Many of them are assholes yes , but they\\'ve got mouths to feed as well . More importantly, no meeting and talking to people in person. #introvert The refund experience has been so good with me. it has never been an hassle. no questions asked no nonsense. Good bot No monopoly is good ever Yeah well we need someone to tackle Mukesh Ambani and keep him under check\\n\\nSo for India, Bezos is a blessing Hi kaoe91. It looks like your comment to /r/india was removed because you have been using a link shortener. Due to issues with spam and malware we do not allow shortened links on this subreddit. Feel free to re-submit using the full URL.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/india) if you have any questions or concerns.* Can you elaborate some more? You live up to your username. This is not how the economy works.\\n\\nOf course, they are a for-profit business and will be making a profit from their investment, but they\\'d do that by creating value (it\\'s NOT a zero-sum game), and as a side-effect result in employment, increased consumption, liquidity in the market and tax rupees for the government coffers. 1 million jobs. No one has able to describe the feeling like you. That is the point. A lot more product and services are available on Amazon than Flipkart. There are hardly any new PS or PC games on Flipkart. And now that it is owned by Walmart, there really is no Indian player in the field Well if you look around, Flipkart still competes with Amazon over selling rights of (mainly) electronic products.\\nThere are hundreds of items which are exclusive to either of the two platforms. Bezos himself wont make achaar. They will spend money to build facilities and hire people. [removed] They do that for a lot of stuff. But the other stuff is still listed and will still get orders. \\n\\nBut just because they list stuff, does not mean people buy them. I still do not consider half their brands. It really depends on user preference. I tried Amazon\\'s own solimo brand items for household laundry, cleaning items as it was cheaper but I still went back to Harpic, Lizol, Pril/Vim because of quality. \\n\\nThere\\'s no reason Amazon can\\'t directly ask the lady to make achaar for them also because Amazon already does partner with a lot of companies to sell under Solimo brand. they tried their hands in fashion dept. which is fucking horrible, cheap garbage clothes Again. It\\'s far fetched. Amazon Basic Achaar and Amazon Basic Pappad yeah. Take a look at solimo, amazonbasics, presto. They are trying to create their Monopoly Exactly, there\\'s Amazon Basics brand which is a rip-off of products that are popular amongst the consumers and have successfully put several small scale manufacturers out of business. It\\'s inevitable that the profitability and recognition of the small scale manufacturers will be short lived once Amazon starts producing items under its own brand.\\n\\nAmazon is a death knell for such manufacturers. I guess, nothing really can be done about it. Vedaka achaar That has been done by brick and mortar chains since decades.\\n\\nIt\\'s funny that Tata and Reliance can launch their own private label brands but Amazon can\\'t. what\\'s your product? What is in Jaipur that you don\\'t find elsewhere? >Heard of Lijjat papad, or dozen other cooperatives supporting smalls businesses all over India. Even something more commercial like masala monk has such products listed.\\n\\nSure, but if Lijjat was not in my neighbourhood store i would not have been able to buy it. As for masala monk, i delayed buying from them for one year because i wondered if it was a legit business or not. Online stores have this trust issue in india because of the scams and for me personally Amazon helps with this because they have good refund policy. helps me pull the trigger on such purchases. \\n\\nAs for the government retort, it was more in the field of enabling small businesses. because as far as evidence goes the government has done the opposite for small businesses. \\n\\n> Sounds like a sob story or a sales pitch. \\n\\nYes this may be true. but after tasting the achaar i would like to believe that story. it was that good.\\n\\ni would put this over even masala monk, who have descriptions better than their products. [Here you go](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07PVNZ1ZD) [Here you go](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07PVNZ1ZD) It is in the comments below. :-) Totally.   \\nDespite the emergence of online retail, I still find it nice to go shopping at Decathlon, Ikea or zara and etc. I don’t feel intimidated and feel fleeced in these stores.   \\nAnd the Quality Decathlon offers for the price  is unmatched. > i bet he does not earn enough to be taxed either. \\n\\nthen how the hell is he able to afford international school?\\n\\nimo lot of retailers do tax evasion.\\n\\na fashion retailer i know bought ₹3 crore flat in delhi apart from 2 flat he already owns along with multiple cars.\\n\\nthey mostly deal in cash so they are bit apprehensive about all the digital payment methods that will show up in their books. They CANNOT give discounts because their margin is less. Product return in Flipkart gave me weeks of trouble. Same crappy service as Reliance digital. \\n\\nSo now I buy books(hardcopy) from Infibeam, nuts from Snapdeal, digital media from Google play, & everything else from Amazon. Amazon can afford to operate at a loss for years, but a small retailer can\\'t.\\n\\nDuring mega sales, Amazon sells products below cost or without making any profits. No wonder many brick and mortar stores are closing down.\\n\\nAs a customer I like Amazon, but I don\\'t buy their \"we are creating millions of jobs\" bullshit. I try. It was already registered in Singapore since it became a unicorn that the only thing keeping it indian, the money flowing back to India, was gone then. Now even the majority shareholders are walmart family. As of now they operate separately, maybe soon they will both combine. As if 4 months ago, i heard they were drawing up plans in how to combine. Walmart labs and flipkart both have separate offices close by in Bengaluru. Snapdeal ? Yeah it was actually a great move to get exclusives, however anti consumer it is in a sense. It\\'s frankly among the only few things selling on flipkart. It\\'s nowhere in danger it seems but they seem to be a steady 2nd with Amazon increasing their lead more and more. > Bezos himself wont make achaar. They will spend money to build facilities and hire people.\\n\\nBut Amazon will corner a bigger part of the profit. Typically people earn either by investing capital or labor. What Amazon is doing is capture the entire profit that is generated by investing capital.  Instead of a person keeping all the profits made on a product they only get to keep the salary.\\n\\nMore delivery boys earning 30 rupees per packet delivered which has a upper bound,  and less shop owners who have a chance to invest more and get bigger.\\n\\nIts futile for anyone to be enterpreneur since they will lose their invested money as amazon will first run them out of business by burning cash capturing market and then reduce them to a delivery boy or a factory worker working for a fixed money So there\\'s no difference between entrepreneur and an employee? In the above example, the achaar lady will be relegated to a mere employee if Amazon takes over. What is \"Amazon Basics\" product line then? If it is illegal for market places to sell, how this amazon basics exist? Nope they found a way around it. They will list their own stuff, show it on top of search, and the lady\\'s aachar will get buried on 20th page of search results Amazon will list all its products on top of the page, making it cumbersome if not difficult for discovery, particularly for new customers. They will provide price discounts and next day shipping to their products. The lady in Rohtak is not able to send her inventory to amazon warehouse to stock it for next-day shipping she will be at a loss as customers have been gamed for prime and next-day shipping.\\n\\nAmazon is no saint. I honestly welcome Jio to beat the bully for a few reasons -\\n\\n1) Jio has the funds and infrastructure to become a tough competitor\\n\\n2) if jio ends up winning, at least the profits will stay in India which in Amazon\\'s case will be repatriated back to the US. She can\\'t produce the volume required, most likely. They are priced that way as well .\\n\\nRs579 for a jogger 😬 Amazon has brands like Solimo,Symbol Metal strips that enable a user to grip and push/pull wooden slabs to allow or bar entry into a room. Janata Janna Chahata he! An app-enabled productivity focused smart notebook. Won\\'t share link here though amazon >As for the government retort, it was more in the field of enabling small businesses\\n\\nIf you talk to anyone who has sold on Amazon and seen any semblance of success, you would know its not true. \\n\\nThis supporting/enabling small sellers drama is just bullshit excuse to cover for the fact that they abuse there position to flood market with white label bullshit while also squeezing their suppliers for margins. This pickle example is more of an exception than the norm solely because they don\\'t have a chinese supplier supplying them pickle in bulk( yet )\\n\\nTbh, if you actually read about their business practices more rather than just forming your opinion on one anecdote you would agree with me The masala monk achaars were splendidly mediocre though. If you are shopping at zara you are definitely getting fleeced on quality. My wife\\'s zara jacket (bought for 2000 in sale) didn\\'t survive one season.\\n\\nZara is absolute shit quality material, that lifestyle will sell you for half the price. >then how the hell is he able to afford international school?\\n\\n>imo lot of retailers do tax evasion.\\n\\nYou answered your own question. He doesn\\'t officially earn enough to get taxed, no matter how much he earns in reality. They exist? I would rather give my money to Amazon instead of Indian retailer Sethjis who are rude to customer and treat them like shit while behaving like they are doing a entire world a favour by middle manning. Totally agree with you. But you forgot one thing. Consumer get the benefit of reduced cost of product. \\n\\nSomething that can be produced at scale must be produced at scale. 1. Free markets doesn\\'t care if that lady has business.\\n2. Amazon taking over still creates jobs and taxes. and her income will drop from 4 lakh/mo to 14 thousand/mo\\n\\nAlso, the employees the lady will hire will be the people she knows well and she will pay a lot more to them than the amazon managers Exactly. \\n\\nThe idea is to figure out hard data on what sells well, and do it in house under that brand. Presto and solimo are amazons brands too Presto and solimo are amazons brands too >at least the profits will stay in India which in Amazon\\'s case will be repatriated back to the US.\\n\\nWell for now there are no profits. for these online sellers, cab aggregators, hotel aggregators, food delivery services, etc. So they are burning cash which is going to the people as cashback, salaries and stuff. \\n\\nIf we assume it makes a profit, they pay taxes which goes to the govt and jio pays taxes which goes to the govt. anything remaining is profit, which amazon may repatriate to the US, and jio will keep in the accounts of reliance. More wealth for them, but does not profit India much imo. Profits staying in India do not help, profits getting spent in India do. \\n\\nAs for jio, I would argue it is the bully and no nice guy. In whatever field Jio enters I will favour the competitor.   ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\_ (ツ) \\\\_/¯ What difference does it make to you if profits stay in the US or in the hands of people who will never use it to your benefit anyway? It won\\'t help the economy, it won\\'t lower prices for you nothing . I agree with your point on Amazon but don\\'t kid yourself into thinking Jio is any better Yeah but so does Reliance like Best Farms, Good Life, Masti Oye, Enzo and Home One.\\n\\nAnd Tata is launching its private label business in a massive way - https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/tatas-plan-private-labels-for-electronic-goods/story-Cc136a91646EF0NKBQULLI.html\\n\\nFuture Group also as many private labels. please pm your product link if you are ok with it Zara is fast fashion. It is supposed to be shit. Ofcourse, its a fast fashion brand. I know what I am getting into and I don\\'t expect Zara products to last longer than 4 months.   \\nIn reality though, My Zara trench coat outlived all my jackets i bought in last 5 years. Sweet burn 😂 Exactly. If the problem is Bezoz making all the profit, the solution is Governments imposing a high Marginial Tax rate on giants like Bezoz to limit their never ending greed. Then government should spend this money it gets from giants like Bezoz on people so that they get a medium wage job in Amazon or Flipkart once they grow up. Then once there are no more REAL JOBS required in economy, the Gov should give decent UBI to the unemployed.\\n\\nSmall retailers in India are simply a nuisance.\\n\\nJust few days ago, I had a heated argument with my optician. He added wrong power in my eyeglasses but was not ready to accept despite proof. A straight out cheat he was. This happened with me before too.\\n\\nThen I got eyeglasses from Lenskart and dear lord, I love them. Pure Perfection with no questions asked return policy.\\n\\nWe need such giants.\\n\\nStop destroying the quality of my life just to provide a small business to bebas maaji in some village if India. \\n\\nMaaji needs government assistance. Not a small and shitty business.\\n\\nIts only the social security given by government to bebas maaji from the high tax money it gets from Giants like Bezoz and Walton\\'s that can save Maaji now from starvation. This! But all those people whose business gets disrupted and are sustenance workers now were my customers. who do I sell to? not to mention the countless articles about terrible working conditions in amazon warehouses. I can\\'t enable Amazon to subject people to work like that.\\n\\nIf amazon drains out profits like that from my citys economy to some offshore haven, who will I sell to?\\n\\nHalf the businesses get disrupted while the other half\\'s businesses are ruined because their customers are gone. plenty of studies in US which show the negative impact of one single Walmart or online sellers like amazon have now on towns prosperity. there are also studies how European lifestyle of buying local and supporting local businesses has a multiplicative effect on prosperity.\\n\\nI will pay little bit extra to a local shopkeeper if that means it comes back to my own business eventually. I reserve online shopping for stuff not available in local markets, preferably from a site not without terrible market practices like amazon Amazon uses the lady to find out what and where the market is and then capitalises on that data. Of course the lady will have a good run for some time but she\\'s just a pawn in the grand scheme of things. >2. Amazon taking over still creates jobs and taxes.\\n\\nGiven Amazon\\'s history of creative accounting and tax avoidance practices, I would bet that there is a net loss in tax revenue than if those products were being sold in other marketplaces. That is exactly what I was saying. But some are arguing that corporate taking over will still ensure more jobs. They fail to realize that temporarily it might, but over time corporate will ensure cost-cutting methods that might do more harm than good, employment wise. Even keeping aside the profit-grabbing. The point you raise is a fundamental question regarding capitalism itself. How given enough time, monopolies develop and make the barriers of entry so large that they don\\'t have any competition. \\n\\nThe negative of a monopoly is usually total control over pricing. As long as they dont abuse it, and forward atleast a portion of the savings from the benefit of economies of scale, monopolies can be good.\\n\\nBut inevitably the power abuse does happen, and then quite often, the barrier to entry is either extremely high, and/or the consolidated industry drives the technology completely in their favour. Is it fair if the barrier to entry is so high that entire generations of people can\\'t raise a decent competitor? Native Companies in E Commerce are doing the same. Small business cant\\'s even compete with these native suppliers, gofers bigbasket and others. Soon they will have to exit too. Once they start profiting, the take the local product off the shelf. No jio will not keep in accounts of reliance, they will invest in their many businesses primarily in India. Reliance is also a Indian public company so the growth of the company will benefit all reliance shareholders. With Amazon the above is not a given particularly the second point. \\nI want more competition in this space. Also we should really appreciate Ambani\\'s guts to go against Amazon which i fee no other indian conglomerate has the guts (see birla an abof).\\nAmazon employs the same business tactics as reliance does - squeezing state and local governments for tax incentives, utilizing tax havens, terrible labor practices.\\nWe should in the end not favor amazon because its a US company or has better tech and its good on western papers or our inherent dislike for ambani\\'s. Lol they will never make profit, either they will spend more on infrastructure so they have almost no net profit or they will use tax havens to siphon of the profits. Difference is that the profits by jio has more probability in getting invested back into the economy generating more growth. With amazon that\\'s not the case. Additional wealth generation potential as reliance is an India public company is a net positive. They are answerable to Indian shareholders and if they expand to other countries, India benefits more.\\nI never said jio is better but what i like is more competition which will be better overall to this sector. [Link](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=door+handles&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) Im looking to buy a trench coat to wear over a suit jacket but i cant find any which could be wore in a formal setting. \\n\\nCan you please post a pic of your trench coat? While I get where you\\'re coming from, the momentum is with Amazon and their like. The workers making the achar will have a stable life not dependent on the whims of their customers as they\\'re part of a much bigger company. Also, the idea of Amazon branded achar sounds silly. Amazon makes enough money by being the most efficient sethji that they don\\'t really care that much.\\n\\nRegarding labour practices, the media will discipline them and they will improve. Also, small businesses shutting down? That\\'s sad but that will force them to innovate and figure out a business idea that works for their community. The people who are enduring sustenance living are likely few and far between. Most people are motivated to figure out something so their kids go to school and their family has a good life.\\n\\nWanting things to be the way they are forever because of what we believe is good without evidence is what\\'s held back India. Those European community-based economies you\\'re talking about? Yeah, that\\'s the odd city or town. Most of Europe is propped up by Amazon-like offline MNCs that were founded a long time back.\\n\\nProfits being repatriated to the West is a problem. There are rules for that preventing capital outflow (it\\'s not easy to move money out of China, for example). The money they earn in India should largely stay in India - I agree with you there. The only way out of this is a honest get Gernment in India that brings decent work conditions and imposes high tax on Amazon.\\n\\nIts not like Amazon will reject India just because of low profits.\\n\\nLow profit is better than No Profit so Amazon will still come to India. [deleted] There are other ways for data collection as well. Stuff have been sold over supplychains long before ecommerce. People already have idea of what can be mass produced.\\n\\nWhy are making this central point of everything. >she\\'s just a pawn in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\nAbsolutely not! What is stopping that Achaar lady to open a shop of her own? If she is producing the goods at her house and saving the facility, advertising, administrative, and other costs to do the business then I believe it\\'s a win-win for her. She is just focusing her energies in the production and manufacturing, thus outsourcing every other function to Amazon including selling.\\n\\nIn a free market, she also has an option to sell on her own, but is she ready to take over the other aspects of the business yet? Considering she is only good at producing the goods and not qualified to compete and sell it to the vast market/the World out there. You are confusing sales tax with income tax > Difference is that the profits by jio has more probability in getting invested back into the economy generating more growth\\n\\nah the never ending trope of growth...\\nIts not a given they\\'ll end up investing. \\nJust because they are indian does not mean they are here to look after the country men. They are only here for the money. Well done. Can\\'t believe I fell for the door knobs Damn I fell for it. This. I wear it over formal shirts.   \\n    \\nhttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR_GVh3G1Xrv0sFWr39fYGKiC4n7z4Nm2BERylzl6YtoQjsSGm4 > Amazon makes enough money by being the most efficient sethji that they don\\'t really care that much.\\n\\nLol. Most efficient. Try predatory pricing. If the cost savings were just due to efficiency they wouldn\\'t have to recapitalise it by 1B $ every year. \\n\\n> That\\'s sad but that will force them to innovate and figure out a business idea that works for their community. \\n\\nPray tell what business model exists against predatory pricing? The \\'Sethji\\' here doesn\\'t have AWS or business in other countries to cross subsidize him.\\n \\n>Regarding labour practices, the media will discipline them and they will improve. \\n\\nRofl, like that has worked in US or our shitty media will go against a billionaire rather than bowing and salivating for ad revenues from Amazon. It will only improve when workers are replaced by robots and drones\\n\\nThey are a marketplace now supposed to compete with their sellers. Yet the site is littered with Amazon white label goods. Yet they have found a workaround around it. Government has literally clarified the policy thrice now, each time they find a loophole and carry on with some restructuring. Shows how much they respect laws.\\n\\n>Wanting things to be the way they are forever because of what we believe is good without evidence is what\\'s held back India\\n\\nYou say this\\n\\n> Most of Europe is propped up by Amazon-like offline MNCs that were founded a long time back.\\n\\nand follow it with a comment without evidence. Come on man. We are but as a customer we are still afforded a choice, the lady has to enlist her products on Amazon to expand her market. She\\'ll start growing and then one day her wings will be cut by Amazon themselves. Now she can\\'t sustain her buisness and by all means could go bankrupt. \\n\\nWe as customers are just made to pay for things we don\\'t want. So is amazon and every other business. I will take my chances with reliance both given their past and as a shareholder than with Amazon. This type of clothing is exactly what im looking for. \\n\\nNow, is it called a *Trench Coat* or an *Overcoat*? I think I would rather do the hard work of doing research for my job. Ultimately, I think you just have an irrational anti-foreign company mindset. If by predatory pricing you mean that they charge goods at a lower cost in order to win market share then that\\'s a perfectly legal business practice. I don\\'t like it and Amazon can be driven out but then someone else will do the same thing. The idea that the media is influenced by ad dollars is just strange. I\\'ve never been influenced in ten years as a journalist in any way by any company. \\n\\nBy new business models, I mean something other than buying goods wholesale and selling them at retail will have to go away just as it has in so many other countries but for that we will need shrewd entrepreneurs able to figure out something that works for the Indian and global market. Unfortunately, we\\'re a nation of followers and not leaders as the risks are high and the capital requirement for business ventures are just too damn high.\\n\\nIn the end, the kirana stores and the politicians will win out and Amazon will have to \\'Go local\\' and stop selling goods but the bandaid will have to be ripped out sometime this decade. We\\'ll have probably have another 1992 style moment next decade. no wonder we\\'ll never get out of this vicious cycle > If by predatory pricing you mean that they charge goods at a lower cost in order to win market share \\n\\nEither you\\'re just ignorant or fucking stupid and I can\\'t tell which one\\n\\nEnjoy your weekend '},\n",

Our IOT project was in full swing and we were adding about 10 or so Jio sims every week. We reached near 40. At the same time our client bought about 500 or so for a campaign audit process - PMUY - a lot of you might know of that. \\n\\nAbout 20 or so my devices were installed at the same or similar spot. I noticed JIO working fine and then the speeds started to go down. The project and the speeds took hit simultaneously so we started to scale down - and JIO raised costs, we scaled down further. \\n\\nYesterday, a decision was made that we would switch from JIO to either Idea or Airtel. We had moved a few devices to Airtel. \\n\\nJio is also sinister in how it operates internally - We would get a 200 response code that we have internet - our devices would ping google.com to check but Jio would transfer to their website and we get a positive response and our guys would think that we need to work on our shit but in truth there was simply no connection. \\n\\nThe above fact just makes you feel so bad, especially when you are bleeding money in the current business scenario. \\n\\nI am not even sure what this guy wants anymore. Suddenly my bsnl doesn't seem so bad. Already knew this would happen one day. Greed of a Gujarati's can't be satisfied until he sits on big pile of money.

Best part is, BSNL is what gives me the best speeds in my hostel. Nice blanket statement you got there We have moved from 250 per Gb to this. Still way better than the old regime Hey man, 'greed of a Gujarati'? That's a bit much no? Ab to within bhi nahi hota, 1 mahine pehle hi ghosna (announcement) kar di jaati hai. So you want me to make a list of all the disasters Gujarati elties have caused to this country. Then have it your way, but then don't come crying that it looks like a Quora paragraph. I don't think so. While poor people from Gujarati has nothing to do with current situation. But Gujarati elite has everything to do with it.
